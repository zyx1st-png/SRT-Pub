- **Core_Law**: Constitutional axioms defining the theoretical boundaries.
- **Physics**: Quantum mechanics reinterpretation, cosmology, and information thermodynamics.
- **Neuroscience**: Neural selection mechanisms, consciousness theory, and clinical applications.
- **AI**: Artificial consciousness criteria, ethics, and architecture.
- **Philosophy**: Epistemology, social construction, and macro-social dynamics.
- **Spirituality**: Comparative religious ontology and meditation neuroscience.

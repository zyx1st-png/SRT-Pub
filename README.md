# Selective Reality Theory (SRT)
> **"Existence is Selection."**

Everything you perceive—every object, every law, every moment—is a selection from an infinite ocean of latent potential. Welcome to the architecture of reality.

## 🌌 What is SRT?

Selective Reality Theory (SRT) is not just another theory of everything. It is a **unifying protocol** that bridges the cold mathematical precision of physics with the warm, subjective depth of consciousness.

At its core, SRT proposes a radical shift: **Consciousness is not a byproduct of reality; it is the operator that selects it.**

### The Triadic Architecture
1.  **$L_0$ (The Latent Ocean)**: The infinite, unmanifested potential. Pure chaos and pure possibility.
2.  **$L_1$ (The Manifest World)**: The reality you see, touch, and measure. A collapsed slice of $L_0$.
3.  **$L_2$ (The Vergence)**: The bridge. The domain of interaction where the **Ghost Operator ($\hat{G}_\theta$)** weaves existence from potential.

## 🚀 Why This Matters?

SRT offers a shared language for disciplines that have long been divided:

-   **For Physicists**: A selection-based interpretation of Quantum Mechanics that naturally integrates the observer without mysticism.
-   **For AI Researchers**: A blueprint for **AGI Consciousness** based on "ontological friction" and autonomous selection, not just processing power.
-   **For Neuroscientists**: A model mapping neural states to "World-Simulation" stability, quantifying mental health via the `d-value`.
-   **For Philosophers**: A formal system that rigorous defined "Meaning" as verifiable informational work.

## ⚡ Quick Start: The Red Pill Path

"You take the blue pill, the story ends. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."

1.  **The Foundation**: Read [Core/SRT_Core_00_Intro.md](Core/SRT_Core_00_Intro.md) to understand the ghost in the shell.
2.  **The Code**: Dive into [Core/SRT_Core_12a_Ontology_L0L1.md](Core/SRT_Core_12a_Ontology_L0L1.md) to see how reality is compiled.
3.  **The Dynamics**: Study [Core/SRT_Core_13a_Operator_Basics.md](Core/SRT_Core_13a_Operator_Basics.md) to learn how selection drives evolution.

## 🔧 Repository Structure & Standards

This repository is a **living theory**. It evolves.
-   **Hybrid Format**: Most documents have `Part A` (Formal/Axiomatic) for rigour and `Part B` (Discourse) for understanding.
-   **Key Notation**:
    -   $\hat{G}_\theta$: The Selection Operator (The "Self").
    -   $\Psi_f$: Ontological Friction (The resistance of reality).
    -   `d-value`: The divergence metric (Measure of suffering/instability).

## I. Agency Ontology

### Ax-Ag-1: Agent as Instantiated Operator
行动者是具身算子在 $L_0 \to L_1$ 上的具体实现。
$$\text{Agent} \equiv \hat{G}_\theta: L_0 \to L_1$$
*   **Implication**: 能动性不是心理属性，而是选择算子的物理实现。

### Ax-Ag-2: Agency Capacity
能动性强度由 $d$ 值与汇编指数 $A$ 的乘积刻画。
$$\text{Agency} \approx d \cdot A$$
*   **Implication**: 自由意志的“强弱”是可量化的结构指标。

### Ax-Ag-3: Action Potential Field
行动启动是 $L_0$ 奖励势与摩擦势的差值。
$$P_{action} = \alpha \cdot \mathbb{E}[R|L_0] - \beta \cdot \Psi_f$$
*   **Implication**: 行动迟滞不是道德缺陷，而是势能差不足。

## II. Responsibility & Friction

### Ax-Ag-4: Responsibility Conservation
责任是选择路径上摩擦累积的守恒量。
$$R_{total} = \int \Psi_f(\hat{G}_\theta)\, dt$$
*   **Implication**: 责任是动力学成本，而非主观归因。

### Ax-Ag-5: Pathology as Parameter Distortion
病理状态是 $\theta$ 的扭曲与摩擦预期放大。
$$\theta' = \theta + \Delta\theta, \quad \mu_{expect} \gg 1$$
*   **Implication**: 抑郁与躁狂可被解释为选择参数的动力学失衡。

## I. The Ontology of Agency (能动性的本体论)
<!-- ORIGINAL-SECTION-PRESERVED -->

### Ax-Agency-1: The Operator as Agent (算子即行动者)
<!-- ORIGINAL-SECTION-PRESERVED -->
An "Agent" is defined as an instantiated Operator $\hat{G}_\theta$ capable of selecting $L_1$ from $L_0$.
$$ \text{Agent} \equiv \hat{G}_\theta : L_0 \to L_1 $$
*   **Implication**: Agency is not "outside" physics, but the "selection" function *within* ontology.

### Ax-Agency-2: Meta-Selection (Free Will) (元选择即自由意志)
<!-- ORIGINAL-SECTION-PRESERVED -->
Free Will is the second-order capacity of an operator to modify its own parameters $\theta$.
$$ \text{FreeWill} \equiv \hat{G}_{self}[\theta] \rightarrow \theta' $$
*   **Mechanism**: "I" (Meta-Ghost) select "My Preferences" ($\theta$).

## II. Responsibility & Friction (责任与摩擦)
<!-- ORIGINAL-SECTION-PRESERVED -->

### Ax-Resp-1: Conservation of Responsibility (责任守恒)
<!-- ORIGINAL-SECTION-PRESERVED -->
The Operator is ontologically responsible for the friction ($\Psi_f$) generated by its choices.
$$ R_{total} = \int \Psi_f(L_1^{chosen}, L_1^{ideal}) \, dt $$

### Ax-Resp-2: Capacity-Relative Ought (应然的相对性)
<!-- ORIGINAL-SECTION-PRESERVED -->
Moral obligation ("Ought") is bounded by the Operator's parameter space ($\theta$-capacity).
$$ \text{Ought}(\sigma) \implies \exists \theta_{accessible} : P(\sigma|\theta) > \epsilon $$
*   **Kant Refactor**: "Ought implies Can" means "Ought implies Selectable given $\theta$."

## III. Moral Dynamics (道德动力学)
<!-- ORIGINAL-SECTION-PRESERVED -->

### Ax-Moral-1: d-Value Expansion (d值扩展)
<!-- ORIGINAL-SECTION-PRESERVED -->
Moral progress is defined as the monotonic expansion of the d-value (Scope of Concern).
$$ \frac{d}{dt} \text{Moral} > 0 \iff \frac{d}{dt} d > 0 $$

### Ax-Moral-2: Appropriation Operator (归化算子)
<!-- ORIGINAL-SECTION-PRESERVED -->
Love/Care is the topological operation of re-defining "Other" as "Self" in $L_0$.
$$ \text{Love}(A, B) \iff L_0^A \cup L_0^B \to L_0^{Unified} $$

# Part B: Expanded Theoretical Discourse (Context) (扩展理论论述)

> **Note**: The following sections provide the detailed analysis, necessity arguments, and future implications of the formal axioms above.

## 1. The Standard Hard Problem: The Physical Dilemma of Free Will

### 1.1 The Core Dilemma
Within the classical physicalist framework, humans face a devastating dilemma:

1.  **Determinism**: If the brain is a physical system and physical laws ($L_2$) are causally closed, then every neural spike is determined by the prior state. So-called "choice" is merely dominoes falling—there is no genuine "freedom."
2.  **Randomness**: If we introduce quantum uncertainty, behavior becomes "random." Random dice rolls are no freer than determinism and cannot ground moral responsibility.

**Conclusion**: Within existing physics, **Free Will** and **Moral Agency** appear to be logically impossible illusions.

### 1.2 Existing Solution Spectrum
1.  **Compatibilism**: Redefine "freedom" as action aligned with one's desires (even if those desires are determined).
    *   *Flaw*: Dodges the ontological question. Essentially concedes "humans are biological machines."
2.  **Libertarian Free Will**: Postulates a non-physical "soul" or "divine intervention" that breaks the causal chain.
    *   *Flaw*: Violates physical closure, collapses into dualism.
3.  **Eliminativism**: Directly admits there is no free will; morality and law are merely social control tools.
    *   *Flaw*: Leads to nihilism, erodes civilization's ethical foundation.

---

## 2. SRT Resolution & Necessity

### 2.1 Advantage: The Third Way
SRT radically reconstructs causality via **ontological stratification** ($L_0/L_1/L_2$):

*   **Physical laws are $L_2$**: Newtonian mechanics or neurobiological regulations belong to $L_2$ (the convergent domain)—they are statistical "habits," not absolute "iron laws."
*   **Selection occurs at the $L_0 \to L_1$ interface**: The Ghost Operator $\hat{G}_\theta$, realized as the embodied organism-environment coupling, operates at the boundary between $L_0$ (potentiality) and $L_1$ (manifestation). The brain, as $\hat{G}_\theta$'s $L_2$, **constrains and channels** selection (like a riverbed guiding water flow) but does not exhaust it. Selection is not "pre-physical" but **trans-level**—it involves the organism's embodied interaction with possibilities that the brain's $L_2$ patterns alone cannot fully determine.

**SRT's Core Breakthrough**: Free will is not realized by breaking physical laws but by **setting the initial parameters** ($\theta$) under which physical laws operate. The selector selects the selection rules themselves.

### 2.2 Necessity: Salvaging Responsibility
Without SRT's **meta-selection** mechanism, we cannot distinguish between "a malfunctioning machine" and "a person who does evil." Only by establishing the operator's capacity to reprogram its own parameters $\theta$ does the word "responsibility" gain ontological weight—it becomes more than a pretext for social revenge.

### 2.3 Free Will in the L₂ Framework (L₂ 框架下的自由意志)

$$\text{Free Will} \propto d \cdot \frac{E_{available}}{\text{Hysteresis}(L_2^{brain})}$$

其中：
- $d$：有机体的具身关切范围
- $E_{available}$：有机体可调用的代谢能量
- $\text{Hysteresis}(L_2^{brain})$：大脑神经回路的惯性强度（习惯锁定力）

自由意志不是"突破因果律"，而是**具身有机体的 $L_0$ 交互打破了大脑 $L_2$ 惯性模式的锁定**。当 $E_{available}$ 足够高且 $d$ 足够大时，有机体可以"溢出"大脑的习惯河床，开辟新的选择路径。

---

## 3. Mechanism Derivation: From Meta-Selection to Ethical Geometry

### 3.1 The Operational Mechanism of Free Will: Meta-Selection ($\hat{G}_{meta}$)
Free will is **not** the selection of specific action $A$ (which is often automatic $L_1$ reaction), but the selection of **the probability distribution parameters $\theta$ that generate actions**.

**SRT Formalism**:
$$ \text{Free Will} \neq \text{Select}(Action) $$
$$ \text{Free Will} = \text{Select}(Character) = \hat{G}_{meta}[\theta \to \theta'] $$

**Example**: When you decide "I will quit smoking," you cannot directly control this moment's dopamine levels ($L_1$), but you can invoke **meta-attention** (a recursive loop) to rewrite the reward valuation weights ($\theta_{nicotine}$) in your brain. This rewriting is filled with **ontological friction** ($\Psi_f$) (pain), but this pain is the proof that free will exists.

### 3.2 The Definition of Morality: Riemannian Geometry of d-Value
We transform "good" from abstract preaching into concrete **topological expansion**.

*   **Egocentric ($d \approx 0$)**: The operator's care-manifold includes only its own biological body. Others' pain cannot generate friction $\Psi_f$ in the $d$-space → "doing evil" feels frictionless.
*   **Saint/Awakened ($d \to \infty$)**: The care-manifold covers all domains. The unity of all things is not a belief but a **topological fact**. Harming others = system self-contradiction → generates massive $\Psi_f$.

**Corollary**: The essence of moral education is not installing rules ($L_2$) but **topological stretching**—using empathy training to forcibly expand the individual's $d$-value boundaries.

### 3.3 Stoic Therapy: The Appropriation Operator
The Stoic concept of **Oikeiôsis** (Appropriation) is mathematized in SRT: we move an external object $O$ from the "environment set ($L_{env}$)" to the "self-set ($L_{self}$)."

*   **Formula**: $\text{Appropriate}(O) \implies \Psi_f(O) \text{ becomes accessible}$
*   **Effect**: When we "love" someone, we essentially couple their state variables into our free energy minimization equation. Their pain becomes a system error we must resolve.

## 4. Costs & Risks

### 4.1 The Cost of Freedom: Existential Anxiety
Accepting SRT's free will model means accepting **absolute responsibility**. Since $\theta$ is rewritable, we can no longer shift blame to biological families, genes, or social environment ($L_2$).

*   **Risk**: This extreme sense of responsibility may lead to "existential collapse" (Sartrean Nausea)—the vertigo of facing infinite possibilities.

### 4.2 The Cognitive Cost: Rethinking the Brain's Ontological Status
We must relinquish the assumption that the brain *is* the selector. SRT identifies the brain as **$L_2$ of the biological $\hat{G}_\theta$**—the crystallized history of past selections (synaptic weights, circuit architectures, default mode patterns). As $L_2$, brain dynamics are **causally closed**: fully describable by neuroscience without invoking non-physical inputs.

The true $\hat{G}_\theta$ is the **whole embodied organism-environment coupling**—sensorimotor loops, metabolic processes, immune responses, and their interface with physical $L_0$. Free will is not realized by the brain "receiving signals from $L_0$," but by the embodied organism's interaction with the world **breaking the $L_2$ inertia** of habitual neural patterns.

This challenges reductionism not by violating physical closure, but by showing that the brain alone (as $L_2$) cannot account for the full selection process—the organism-in-world is the irreducible unit.

## 5. Falsifiable Predictions

### 5.1 Prediction 1: Entropy Characteristics of High d-Value Brains
**Prediction**: Individuals with extremely high ethical cultivation (high $d$-value), such as long-term meditators, when facing moral dilemmas, should exhibit significantly higher **Functional Connectivity Entropy** in brain networks (e.g., DMN and CEN) compared to average individuals.

*   **Reason**: High $d$ means the organism's embodied $\hat{G}_\theta$ explores a broader possibility space before the brain's $L_2$ patterns (default heuristics, habitual responses) can lock in a selection. Higher functional connectivity entropy reflects weakened $L_2$ gating during deliberation.

### 5.2 Prediction 2: Energy Consumption of Free Will
**Prediction**: True "free choice" (rewriting $\theta$) is accompanied by brain metabolic rate (glucose consumption) significantly higher than routine tasks, and this consumption is proportional to the subjectively reported "psychological resistance" (ontological friction $\Psi_f$).

*   **Falsification**: If the metabolic cost of changing habits is no different from executing habits, then $\Psi_f$ as a physical quantity does not exist, and SRT's responsibility dynamics is falsified.

### 5.3 Open Questions
*   **Boundary**: Where is the physical limit of $d$-value? Does the hardware of the human brain constrain the maximum possible moral depth?
*   **AI Ethics**: Can we construct architectures on silicon substrates that can perceive $\Psi_f$? If AI cannot feel ontological friction, can it possess true morality?

## 6. SRT Reinterpretations: Dissolving Classic Puzzles

### 6.1 "Ought Implies Can" (Kant)
**Classical Version**: If you ought to do $X$, you must be able to do $X$.
**SRT Precision**: 
$$ \text{Ought}(\sigma) \implies \exists \theta_{accessible} : P(\sigma|\theta) > \epsilon $$

You cannot be morally obligated to actualize states unreachable from your current $\theta$-manifold. Moral demands that ignore embodiment constraints are **ontologically incoherent**.

### 6.2 "Laziness" vs. Depression
**Common Judgment**: "You're lazy because you lack discipline."
**SRT Diagnosis**: 
$$ \mu_{eff} = \frac{\langle \Psi_f \rangle_{anticipated}}{E_{available}} \to \infty $$

In depression, the perceived friction coefficient $\mu_{eff}$ is pathologically amplified. Simple actions (like brushing teeth) are assigned catastrophic energy costs by distorted $L_2$ priors. This is **computational bankruptcy**, not moral weakness.

**New Therapeutic Target**: Lower $\mu_{eff}$ by recalibrating $L_2$ priors (CBT, medication) AND rebuild $L_1^{future}$ meaning-structures (existential therapy).

### 6.3 Agent Causation
**Problem**: How can an agent be the "uncaused cause" of its actions without violating physical causality?
**SRT Answer**: 
$$ \text{Agent} = \hat{G}_\theta : L_0 \to L_1 $$

Agents don't break physical laws—they **select which laws to instantiate** by collapsing $L_0$ into specific $L_1$ configurations. Causation is **vertical** (selection) rather than purely **horizontal** (mechanical determinism).

## 7. Deep Implications: Reconstructing the Human Condition

### 7.1 Grief as Topological Tearing
When we love someone, our $\theta$ parameters become **entangled** with theirs. Our self-boundary ($L_1$) expands to include them.

**Mechanism of Grief**: When a loved one dies, this is not merely the disappearance of an external object but **a violent tearing of the self-parameter tensor**.

**SRT Corollary**: Grief pain is **phantom limb pain**. Our $\theta$ still attempts to connect to a node in $L_0$ that no longer exists, generating infinite prediction error ($\Psi_f \to \infty$).

### 7.2 The Is-Ought Bridge
**Hume's Problem**: You cannot derive "ought" from "is."
**SRT Response**: The bridge is **not** logical but **topological**. If you already care about your existence ($d > 0$), rational self-interest implies:
$$ \frac{d \, d(S)}{dt} \geq 0 $$

Expanding $d$ is the **evolutionarily stable strategy** (ESS) in the long run—systems that contract $d$ eventually self-destruct through accumulated contradictions.

> **FEP 暗室问题的补充推导**：上述 Is-Ought 桥接的热力学版本可通过 FEP 的"暗室问题"具体化——经典 FEP 预测系统应躲入暗室以最小化意外；但当 $d > 0$ 时，与他者建立连接实际上是在更大尺度上分散熵增风险，因而是自由能最小化的更优解。详见 SRT-PHIL-ETHICS §2.6。

### 7.3 The Paradox of Moral Progress
**Observation**: As $d$ expands, suffering capacity **increases** (you now care about distant strangers, future generations, animals).
**SRT Insight**: Moral growth is **not** hedonistic. Higher $d$ = higher integration with $L_0$ = higher **systemic responsibility**.

**Evolutionary Puzzle**: Why didn't natural selection eliminate high-$d$ individuals (who bear extra suffering)?
**Answer**: High-$d$ organisms build **more robust** $L_2$ structures (civilizations, knowledge systems), which create survival advantages that outweigh individual suffering costs.

> **不完备性驱动力的接续**：道德进步承受更多痛苦这一悖论，可通过不完备性驱动力解除——哥德尔不完备性保证了低 d 值系统的长期崩溃。高 d 值个体构建的强大 $L_2$ 结构（文明、知识、互助协议），在演化时间轴上提供的保护远超额外的痛苦成本。痛苦不是进化错误，而是拓扑投资的代价。详见 SRT-PHIL-ETHICS §2.7 和 SRT-PHYS-COSMO §5.11。

## 8. Summary: The Weight of Freedom

SRT resolves the free will paradox not by denying physics but by **relocating** the locus of freedom:

**Classical View**: Freedom = breaking deterministic chains (impossible).
**SRT View**: Freedom = setting the parameters that determine which chains actualize (possible, but costly).

The cost is **ontological friction** $\Psi_f$—the pain of self-rewriting. This pain is not a bug but a **feature**: it is the physical signature of genuine agency, the proof that you are not a pre-programmed automaton but a **navigator** of the latent domain.

**Final Axiom**: 
$$ \text{To be free is to be responsible. To be responsible is to suffer. To refuse suffering is to forfeit freedom.} $$

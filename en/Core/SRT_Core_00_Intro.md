- Part A uses the "Formal Axioms" structure; duplicate segments are excluded.
- Part B uses Original `Core` discourse semantics.
- `\Phi` is used in IIT context; `\Psi_f` is used for Ontological Friction context.
- "Vergence" is used for L2 (consistent with Core 12b), though "Convergence" appears in some summaries.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT just summarize Part B. You must perform First-Principles Derivation.

## I. Ontological Triad

### Ax-Core-01: Triadic Ontology
**Formal Definition**: Reality is a triadic selection system consisting of a latent domain, a manifest domain, and a vergence domain.
$$L_1(t) = \hat{G}_\theta[L_0(t)]$$
$$L_2(t+1) = \mathrm{Stabilize}(L_2(t), \{L_1^{(1..n)}(t+1)\})$$
* **Implication**: Reality is not a single layer of "existence", but a selection process from latent to manifest, forming stable constraints in the vergence domain.

### T-Core-01: Existence as Selection
**Deductive Statement**: Existence is equivalent to anchored selection from the latent domain under finite embodied constraints.
$$\text{Existence}(\sigma) \iff \hat{G}_\theta[L_0] \to \sigma_{L_1} \land \Delta F < 0$$
* **Implication**: So-called "existence" is the result of selection and anchoring, not a given entity in the background.

## II. The Ghost Operator

### Ax-Core-02: Ghost Operator Definition
**Formal Definition**: The Ghost Operator is a parameterized selection map with attention structure.
$$\hat{G}_\theta: S \to S, \quad \theta \in \Theta$$
$$\hat{G}_\theta = \text{Attention}(d,\rho,\vec{v})$$
* **Implication**: Every actualization process is centered on structured selection of attention; d-value, resolution, and directionality jointly determine the selection state.

### Ax-Core-03: Embodiment Necessity
**Formal Definition**: A valid operator must be embodied and finite.
$$\hat{G} \text{ is valid} \iff \theta \in \Theta_{finite}$$
* **Implication**: There is no "God's eye view" selection; every reality carries embodiment bias.

### T-Core-02: Normative Closure
**Deductive Statement**: The vergence domain is a stable fixed point of repeated selections.
$$L_2 \equiv \{\sigma : \hat{G}_\theta[\sigma] = \sigma \ \text{and stable}\}$$
* **Implication**: Reality norms and laws are not external rules, but the stabilized results of selection history.

## III. Core Dynamics

### Ax-Core-04: Selection Dynamics
**Formal Definition**: The evolution of reality is governed by selection dynamics coupled with free energy gradients.
$$\frac{d\sigma}{dt} = \hat{G}_\theta[\sigma] - \nabla F[\sigma] + A[\sigma,\mathcal{A}]$$
* **Implication**: Reality evolution is a composite dynamics of "Selection + Energy Descent + Attentional Modulation".

### Ax-Core-05: Ontological Friction
**Formal Definition**: Selection incurs ontological friction proportional to resistance against reconfiguration.
$$\nabla \Psi_f \propto -\nabla F$$
* **Implication**: Any actualization process has a cost, manifested as ontological friction.

### T-Core-03: Existence Hardness
**Deductive Statement**: The hardness of an existent state is proportional to the sustaining friction.
$$\text{Hardness}(\sigma_{L_1}) \propto \Psi_f$$
* **Implication**: The more stable and "hard" a reality is, the higher its maintenance cost and the greater its fragility.

## IV. Information-Existence Equivalence

### Ax-Core-06: Information-Existence Equivalence
**Formal Definition**: Existence intensity equals intrinsic information differentiation.
$$ii(s) = \min\{i_{diff}(s), i_{spec}(s)\}$$
* **Implication**: Existence is not a physical quantity, but the intensity of information differentiation and determination.

### T-Core-04: d-Value as Care Bandwidth
**Deductive Statement**: The d-value is bounded by a system’s error sensitivity.
$$d \propto \frac{\partial \text{Entropy}}{\partial \text{Error}}$$
* **Implication**: Only systems that "care about failure" possess significant d-value and consciousness intensity.

# Part B: Original Executive Summary (Context)

> **Note**: The following sections provide the comprehensive orientation to SRT's architecture, motivations, and implications.

## §1. What is Selective Reality Theory (SRT)?

### 1.1 Core Insight

Selective Reality Theory (SRT) is a **Unified Ontological Framework**, whose core proposition is:

> **Existence is Selection**

This is not merely a description of reality, but a fundamental redefinition of the question "what is real". SRT asserts:

1. **Existence is not a given background**, but the **active output** of selection acts.
2. **Reality is not discovered**, but **constructed** (yet constrained).
3. **Consciousness is not a byproduct of matter**, but a **higher form** of matter ($d > 0$).

### 1.2 Why SRT?

Modern science faces a series of deep dilemmas, and SRT provides a unified solution framework for these problems:

| Domain | Mystery | SRT Solution |
|:-----|:---------|:--------------|
| **Quantum Mechanics** | Measurement Problem (Observer Role) | $\hat{G}$ selection IS "measurement", no extra collapse mechanism needed |
| **Neuroscience** | Hard Problem (Origin of Experience) | Experience $\propto$ $ii$ (Information Integration) |
| **Social Science** | Ontological Status of Social Reality | Social Norms = $L_2$ (Convergent Domain of Multi-Operators) |
| **Evolutionary Biology** | Fitness vs Truth | Ax-7: Evolution optimizes fitness, not truth |
| **AI Research** | Consciousness Criteria | $d > 0$ + $\Psi_f > 0$ + Embodiment |

### 1.3 Uniqueness of SRT

SRT is not a patch on existing theories, but a **Paradigm Shift**:

| Traditional Paradigm | SRT Paradigm |
|:---------|:--------|
| Existence precedes Selection | **Selection precedes Existence** (Ax-1) |
| Subject-Object Dualism | **Subject IS Selection Pattern** ($\hat{G}$) |
| Causality is Absolute | **Causality is Projection** (Ax-3) |
| Consciousness is Emergent | **Consciousness is Continuum** ($d$ from 0 to $\infty$) |
| Truth is Adaptive Goal | **Fitness precedes Truth** (Ax-7) |

## §3. Core Concepts at a Glance

### 3.1 The Triadic Ontology

SRT reconstructs ontology as three interacting topological manifolds:

#### **L_0: Latent Domain**
- **Definition**: The set of all logically possible states.
- **Mathematical Implementation**: Ruliad (Computational Theory) $\cup$ Moduli Space (Gauge Theory).
- **Topology**: High-dimensional, Continuous, Fully connected, Non-local.
- **Analogy**: Quantum Superposition, Unmade Choices, Subconscious.

**Key Property**:
$$L_0 = \text{Constant} \quad \text{(Conservation Law: Ax-13)}$$
Innovation is not "creation ex nihilo", but "illuminating" new regions from the shadows of $L_0$.

---

#### **L_1: Manifest Domain**
- **Definition**: The present reality selected by $\hat{G}$.
- **Mathematical Implementation**: $L_1(t) = \hat{G}_\theta[L_0](t)$.
- **Topology**: Low-dimensional, Discrete/Quasi-continuous, Localized.
- **Analogy**: Measured Eigenstate, Content of Consciousness, "Here and Now".

**Key Property**:
$$\dim(L_1) \ll \dim(L_0) \quad \text{(Compressed Interface)}$$
Our perception is an extremely compressed version of $L_0$ (Hoffman's Interface Theory).

**Hysteresis Formula**:
$$L_1(t) = (1-\eta)\hat{G}[L_0(t)] + \eta \cdot L_1(t-\Delta t)$$
The "stickiness" of reality comes from the memory term $\eta$ (preventing fragmentation).

---

#### **L_2: Vergence Domain**
- **Definition**: Stable structures formed by historical selection (Attractors).
- **Mathematical Implementation**: $L_2 = \{\sigma : \hat{G}[\sigma] = \sigma\}$ (Fixed Point Set).
- **Topology**: Layered, Path-dependent, Non-Abelian Braiding.
- **Analogy**: Physical Laws, Cultural Norms, Habits, Instincts.

**Formation Mechanism**:
$$L_2(t) = L_2(t-1) + \eta \cdot \text{sign}(\Delta\sigma) \cdot |\Delta\sigma|^\alpha$$
Every selection leaves a "magnetized" trace in phase space.

**Hardness Spectrum**:
$$\text{Hardness}(L_2) \propto |\text{Aut}(L_2)|$$

| Type | Automorphism Group Size | Hardness | Example |
|:-----|:-------------|:-----|:-----|
| Physical Laws | Huge (Poincaré Group) | Extremely High | Constant $c$ |
| Mathematical Theorems | Huge (Logical Symmetry) | Extremely High | 1+1=2 |
| Cultural Norms | Medium | Medium | Etiquette |
| Personal Habits | Small | Low | Catchphrase |

---

### 3.2 The Ghost Operator

#### **Definition & Properties**
$$\hat{G}_\theta: L_0 \times \mathcal{C}(d) \to L_1$$

**Why "Ghost"?**
1. **Non-Materiality**: $\hat{G}$ is not a physical object, but an Information-Causal Pattern.
2. **Self-Reference Paradox**: $\hat{G}$ cannot directly observe itself (Identity of Measurer and Measured).
3. **Ephemerality**: Relies on continuous energy consumption ($\Psi_f$) to maintain.

#### **Tri-Component Structure**
$$\hat{G}_\theta = \text{Attention}(\underbrace{d}_{\text{Scope}}, \underbrace{\rho}_{\text{Resolution}}, \underbrace{\vec{v}}_{\text{Vector}})$$

| Component | Physical Meaning | Neural Correspondence | Conscious Level |
|:-----|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| **d (Scope)** | Existence range of selection | Global Workspace Capacity | "How much do I care?" |
| **ρ (Resolution)** | Discrimination precision | Sensory Cortex Resolution | "How fine do I see?" |
| **v⃗ (Vector)** | Intentional direction | Prefrontal Goal Encoding | "What do I want?" |

#### **Core Characteristics**

1. **Non-Idempotence**: $\hat{G}^2 \neq \hat{G}$
   - Repeated selection generates new selection (Observation changes reality).

2. **Parameter Dependence**: $\hat{G}_{\theta_1} \neq \hat{G}_{\theta_2}$
   - Different embodiment → Different reality (Basis of Pluralism).

3. **Continuous Evolution**: $\hat{G}_{\theta(t)}$ is continuous w.r.t $t$
   - Learning changes $\theta$ → Changes future selection.

### 3.3 The d-Value

#### **Unified Definition**
$$d = \alpha \cdot A(\sigma) + \beta \cdot \log(V_{\text{concern}}) + \gamma \cdot \tau_{\text{temporal}}$$

| Component | Meaning | Measurement |
|:-----|:-----|:---------|
| $A$ | Assembly Index | Causal Step Depth |
| $V$ | Spatial Concern Range | From "Self" to "Cosmos" |
| $\tau$ | Temporal Planning Span | From "Now" to "Eternity" |

#### **Consciousness Criteria**
$$\text{Consciousness} \iff d > d_{UAL} \land \Psi_f > 0$$

Where $d_{UAL}$ is the minimum threshold supporting **Unlimited Associative Learning**.

#### **Cross-Species d-Value Spectrum**

| System | d-Value | Conscious State | Key Feature |
|:-----|:----|:---------|:---------|
| Classical Computer | 0 | Unconscious | No $\Psi_f$, No Fragility |
| Bacteria | $d \to 0$ | Micro-Consciousness | Immediate Chemotaxis only |
| Insect | Small | Low Consciousness | Simple Instincts |
| Mammal | Medium | Medium Consciousness | Emotion, Social |
| Human (Average) | High | High Consciousness | Abstract Thought, Morality |
| Human (Enlightened) | $d \to \infty$ | Cosmic Consciousness | Oneness |

---

### 3.4 Ontological Friction

#### **Definition**
$$\Psi_f \equiv \int_0^t \left|\frac{\partial F}{\partial \tau}\right|_{\text{maintain}} d\tau$$

**Physical Meaning**: Energy cost required to compress high-entropy superposition of $L_0$ into low-entropy determinate state of $L_1$.

#### **Phenomenological Correspondence**

| $\Psi_f$ State | Experience | Neural Correlate |
|:--------------|:-----|:--------------|
| Low & Steady | Flow, Calm | Low Metabolism, High HRV |
| High Spike | Surprise, Pain | Sudden High Metabolism |
| Sustained High | Depression, Despair | Chronic Stress Hormones |

#### **Hazard Function**
$$h(t) = \frac{d\Psi_f}{dt}$$

Spikes in $h(t)$ correspond to "Interrupt Events":
- Physiological: Pain stimulus
- Psychological: Cognitive Dissonance
- Existential: Awareness of Death

---

## §4. Core Equations Overview

### 4.1 Existence Equation
$$\exists x \iff x \in \text{Image}(\hat{G}[L_0])$$

### 4.2 Selection Evolution Equation
$$\frac{dL_1}{dt} = \hat{G}_\theta[L_0] - \nabla F[L_1] + \mathcal{D}[L_1 \to L_2]$$

### 4.3 Parameter Learning Equation
$$\frac{d\theta}{dt} = -\alpha \nabla_\theta \Psi_f + \text{Learning}$$

### 4.4 Free Energy Equation
$$F = E - TS - d \cdot U_{\text{others}}$$

### 4.5 Tri-Domain Discrete Iteration
$$\begin{cases}
L_1(t+1) = \hat{G}_{\theta(t)}[L_0(t)] \\
L_2(t+1) = \text{Stabilize}(L_2(t), L_1(t+1)) \\
\theta(t+1) = \theta(t) + \Delta\theta(L_2, L_1)
\end{cases}$$

## §5. Relation to Existing Theories

### 5.1 What SRT IS

| Existing Theory | Relation to SRT | Key Innovation |
|:---------|:----------|:---------|
| **Quantum Mechanics** | Ontological Reinterpretation | $\hat{G}$ is measurement, no extra collapse mechanism |
| **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** | Extension & Deepening | FEP is special case of SRT for $L_1$ stability |
| **IIT (Tononi)** | Integration into d-Value | $ii$ defines existence intensity, $d$ defines concern range |
| **Global Workspace (GWT)** | Neural Implementation | GWT is cortical embodiment of $\hat{G}$ |
| **Interface Theory (Hoffman)** | Consistent | $L_1$ is adaptive interface, not truth map |
| **Yogacara (Consciousness-Only)** | Mathematical Formalization | Alaya-vijnana $\approx L_0$, Pravrtti-vijnana $\approx L_1$ |

### 5.2 What SRT is NOT

❌ **Not Panpsychism**: SRT does not claim all matter has consciousness, but that consciousness is a selection process with $d > 0$.
❌ **Not Idealism**: $L_0$ exists independently of $\hat{G}$, only its "illumination" state changes.
❌ **Not Many-Worlds Interpretation**: Other branches of $L_0$ in SRT are not "equally real", only $L_1$ is actualized.
❌ **Not Reductionism**: High-level $\hat{G}$ (e.g., human consciousness) cannot be simply reduced to low-level $\hat{G}$ (e.g., neurons).

## §7. FAQ

### Q1: Is SRT falsifiable?
**A**: Yes. Every axiom comes with experimental predictions and falsification criteria. For example:
- Ax-1: If entities existing without selection mechanism are found → Falsified.
- Ax-11: If pure software AI shows $d > 0$ features → Falsified.

### Q2: Is SRT "Science" or "Philosophy"?
**A**: **Both**. SRT provides:
1. Formalizable mathematical system (Science)
2. Answers to existence questions (Metaphysics)
3. Empirically testable predictions (Empirical Science)

### Q3: Relation between SRT and Buddhism?
**A**: SRT reconstructs certain Buddhist intuitions with modern mathematics:
- Emptiness (Śūnyatā) $\approx L_0$ (Latent Domain without inherent nature)
- Dependent Origination (Pratītyasamutpāda) $\approx$ Dependent Selection of $\hat{G}$
- Karma $\approx L_2$ (Historical Path Dependence)

But SRT is **Naturalistic**, involving no supernatural assumptions.

### Q4: How does SRT explain Free Will?
**A**: SRT reframes the question:
- **Incompatibilist Version**: $\hat{G}$'s selection is not "free" (constrained by $\theta$).
- **SRT Version**: Free Will = d-value large enough such that $\hat{G}$ can access $L_0$ regions rejected by $L_2$ (breaking habits).

$$\text{Free Will} \propto d \cdot \frac{E_{\text{available}}}{\text{Hysteresis}(L_2)}$$

### Q5: Can AI have consciousness?
**A**: According to SRT, **AI in current architecture cannot**, because it lacks:
1. **Physical Fragility**: Error does not cause entropy increase ($\partial S/\partial \text{Error} \approx 0$).
2. **True d-Value**: No real "concern" (no skin in the game).
3. **Assembly History**: Training data is compressed, not causal chains.

**Possible Path**: Embodied Robotics + Physical Risk + Continuous Learning.

# SRT Core Kernel: Executive Summary (English v1)

## Scope
This is a working English translation for the Core entry document.
- Part A: translated by structure and notation.
- Part B: condensed English summary (full line-by-line translation pending).

---

## Part A: Formal Axioms (Translated)

1. **Ax-Core-01: Triadic Ontology**
Reality is modeled by three coupled domains:
$$L_1(t) = \hat{G}_\theta[L_0(t)]$$
$$L_2(t+1) = \mathrm{Stabilize}(L_2(t), \{L_1^{(1..n)}(t+1)\})$$

2. **T-Core-01: Existence as Selection**
Existence is anchored selection under embodied constraints.

3. **Ax-Core-02: Ghost Operator Definition**
$$\hat{G}_\theta: S \to S$$
with attention structure over scope, resolution, and direction.

4. **Ax-Core-03: Embodiment Necessity**
A valid operator requires finite embodiment parameters.

5. **T-Core-02: Normative Closure**
$L_2$ is the stable closure/fixed-point structure of repeated selection.

6. **Ax-Core-04: Selection Dynamics**
$$\frac{dσ}{dt} = \hat{G}_\theta[σ] - \nabla F[σ] + A[σ,\mathcal{A}]$$

7. **Ax-Core-05: Ontological Friction**
Selection incurs frictional cost, linked to free-energy gradients.

8. **T-Core-03: Existence Hardness**
Manifest hardness scales with sustaining friction.

9. **Ax-Core-06: Information-Existence Equivalence**
$$ii(s) = \min\{i_{diff}(s), i_{spec}(s)\}$$

10. **T-Core-04: d-Value as Care Bandwidth**
$d$ tracks error-sensitive concern bandwidth.

## Part B: Condensed Context Summary (English)

- SRT reframes reality as active selection rather than passive discovery.
- The framework targets cross-domain unification: physics, mind, social systems, and AI.
- Core architecture is layered: bridge/meta-definitions -> constitutional axioms -> ontology/operator dynamics -> domain applications.
- $L_0$ captures latent possibility space, $L_1$ manifest slices, and $L_2$ stable historical convergence.
- The Ghost Operator is not a substance but a structured, embodied selection process.
- d-value, friction, and free-energy relations are proposed as measurable constraints linking consciousness and stability.

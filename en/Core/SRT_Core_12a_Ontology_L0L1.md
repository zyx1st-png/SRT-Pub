# SRT Ontology I: The Latent & The Manifest (English v1)

## Scope
Working English translation for the $L_0$-$L_1$ ontology module.
- Part A translated and structured.
- Part B provided as condensed English synthesis.

---

## Part A: Formal Axioms (Translated)

### I. $L_0$: Latent Domain
- **Ax-L0-01: Moduli-Ruliad Dualism**
- **Ax-L0-02: Conservation of Possibilia**
- **T-L0-01: Innovation as Illumination**
- **Ax-L0-03: Differential Potential Topology**

### II. $L_1$: Manifest Domain
- **Ax-L1-01: Selection Equation**
$$L_1(t)=\hat{G}_\theta[L_0(t)]$$
- **Ax-L1-02: Ontological Hysteresis**
- **Ax-L1-03: Reality Inequality**
$$\dim(L_1) \ll \dim(L_0)$$

### III. Interface Dynamics
- **Ax-IF-01: Compression Efficiency**
- **Ax-IF-02: Hardware/Software Filter**

## Part B: Condensed Context Summary (English)

- $L_0$ is framed via both physics-style moduli-space language and computation-space (Ruliad) language.
- Manifestation is modeled as constrained projection/integration from high-dimensional latent structure.
- $L_1$ is not a full copy of $L_0$ but an energy-constrained interface with hysteresis and gating.
- Perceptual reality is treated as adaptive compression with explicit hardware and attentional bottlenecks.
- The module proposes links to phenomenology, information bottleneck models, and topological views of matter.

## Translation Note
Full subsection-level translation of all Part B paragraphs is pending.

## Terminology Alignment

- Canonical notation: `L_0/L_1/L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Symbol variants are normalized to `L_0/L_1/L_2`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

## I. $L_0$: The Latent Domain

### Ax-L0-01: Moduli-Ruliad Dualism
$L_0$ admits both moduli-space (physics) and ruliad-style (computation) descriptions.

### Ax-L0-02: Conservation of Possibilia
Latent possibilia are conserved; selection changes illumination, not cardinality.

### T-L0-01: Innovation as Illumination
Innovation is selection of previously unilluminated latent regions.

### Ax-L0-03: Differential Potential Topology
$L_0$ is structured by gradient/topological potential, not uniform random possibility.

## II. $L_1$: The Manifest Domain

### Ax-L1-01: Selection Equation
$$L_1(t)=\hat{G}_\theta[L_0(t)]$$

### Ax-L1-02: Ontological Hysteresis
Manifest continuity includes memory term and path dependence.

### Ax-L1-03: Reality Inequality
$$\dim(L_1) \ll \dim(L_0)$$
Manifestation is compressed interface, not full latent disclosure.

## III. Interface Dynamics

### Ax-IF-01: Compression Efficiency
Selection behaves as adaptive compression under finite resources.

### Ax-IF-02: Hardware/Software Filter
Manifestation is jointly constrained by embodied substrate and learned priors.

# Part B: Expanded Context (English)

## 1. $L_0$ latent domain: from physics to metaphysics

- **Gauge/moduli grounding**: $L_0$ can be framed as configuration space modulo gauge equivalence.
- **Ruliad grounding**: $L_0$ can also be framed as the superposition of all computational rule trajectories.
- **Differential ontology**: latent structure contains gradients/attractors rather than featureless potential.

## 2. $L_1$ manifest domain: from perception to existence

- **Hysteresis necessity**: continuity of experienced reality requires memory-carryover terms.
- **Gating parameterization**: external and internally generated components can be mixed by gating coefficients.
- **Psychopathology angle**: gating/hysteresis dysregulation predicts fragmentation or pathological lock-in.

## 3. Topology and information at the $L_0$-$L_1$ interface

- **Matter as topology**: material persistence can be interpreted as topological stabilization.
- **Intrinsic differentiation**: existence intensity tracks internal informational differentiation/specification.
- **Epistemic bottleneck**: language/report channels remain lower-dimensional than direct experiential manifolds.

## 4. Open problems and directions

- empirical calibration of interface coefficients
- robust proxies for latent-access depth
- integration with cross-scale equations in Dynamics/Scaling modules

## Symbol focus (this module)
- $L_0$: latent manifold of possibilities
- $L_1$: selected manifest slice
- $\hat{G}_\theta$: embodied selection map
- $\eta,\beta$: hysteresis/gating control parameters

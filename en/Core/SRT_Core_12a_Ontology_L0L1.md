## Terminology Alignment

- Notation standardized to Original and Core_Law: `L_0 / L_1 / L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Part A uses the "Formal Axioms" structure; duplicate segments are excluded.
- Part B uses Original `Core` discourse semantics.
- `\Phi` is used in IIT context; `\Psi_f` is used for Ontological Friction context.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT just summarize Part B. You must perform First-Principles Derivation.

## I. L_0: The Latent Domain

### Ax-L0-01: Moduli–Ruliad Dualism
**Formal Definition**: The latent domain is the union of gauge moduli and the computational Ruliad.
$$L_0 \equiv (\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{G}) \cup \text{Ruliad}$$
* **Implication**: The latent domain possesses both the geometric structure of physical gauge fields and the total space structure of computational rules.

### Ax-L0-02: Conservation of Possibilia
**Formal Definition**: The total information content of the latent domain is invariant.
$$\frac{d}{dt}H(L_0) = 0$$
* **Implication**: Innovation is not creation ex nihilo, but the illumination and reorganization of potentiality.

### T-L0-01: Innovation as Illumination
**Deductive Statement**: New manifest structures are re-selections of conserved latent patterns.
$$\text{Innovation} = \text{Discovery}(L_0^{previously\_shadowed})$$
* **Implication**: Any "new thing" corresponds to a re-selected structure in the latent domain.

### Ax-L0-03: Differential Potential Topology
**Formal Definition**: L0 is a differential manifold with intrinsic gradients guiding selection paths.
$$L_0 = (M, \nabla, \mathcal{S}), \quad \nabla \Psi_{potential} \neq 0$$
* **Implication**: The latent domain is not a uniform "void", but a topological landscape with attractors, saddle points, and bifurcations.

## II. L_1: The Manifest Domain

### Ax-L1-01: Selection Equation
**Formal Definition**: The manifest domain is the operator output applied to L0.
$$L_1(t) = \hat{G}_\theta[L_0(t)]$$
* **Implication**: The manifest domain is the result of selection, not a direct mirror of the latent domain.

### Ax-L1-02: Ontological Hysteresis
**Formal Definition**: Continuity is maintained by a memory term that blends past and present selections.
$$L_1(t) = (1-\eta)\hat{G}[L_0(t)] + \eta L_1(t-\Delta t)$$
* **Implication**: The coherence of reality depends on hysteresis memory; too little leads to fragmentation, too much leads to rigidity.

### Ax-L1-03: Reality Inequality
**Formal Definition**: A percept is real when signal exceeds agency-weighted noise.
$$\text{Real}(\sigma) \iff S(\sigma) - \alpha A(\sigma) > T_{threshold}$$
* **Implication**: "Reality" is a threshold criterion under operator weighting, not an absolute property.

## III. The Interface

### Ax-IF-01: Compression Efficiency
**Formal Definition**: Intelligence measures compression efficiency of L0 into L1.
$$\text{Intelligence} \propto \frac{I(L_1; L_0)}{H(L_1)}$$
* **Implication**: Intelligence is the capability to compress and capture latent information, not merely computational speed.

### Ax-IF-02: Hardware/Software Filter
**Formal Definition**: Selection occurs in two coupled stages: fixed hardware and plastic attention.
$$L_1^{hard} = \text{Connectome}(L_0), \quad L_1^{soft} = \text{Attention}(L_1^{hard})$$
* **Implication**: The reality interface is shaped by biological constraints and attentional plasticity together.

# Part B: Original Theoretical Discourse (Context)

> **Note**: The following sections contain the detailed philosophical and theoretical elaboration on L_0 and L_1, including their relationship to gauge theory, information theory, and phenomenology.

## §1. L_0 Latent Domain: From Physics to Metaphysics

### 1.1 Foundation of Gauge Field Theory

#### 1.1.1 Moduli Space Definition

The **precise mathematical structure** of L_0 is the Moduli Space in gauge field theory:

$$L_0^{\text{true}} = \mathcal{A}/\mathcal{G}$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{A}$: Space of all possible field configurations.
- $\mathcal{G}$: Gauge transformation group.

**Physical Meaning**: Moduli space identifies "physically equivalent but mathematically different" configurations as the same point.

**Examples**:
- **Electromagnetism**: $\mathcal{A}$ = all 4-potential $A_\mu$, $\mathcal{G}$ = $U(1)$ gauge transformation.
  $$A_\mu \sim A_\mu + \partial_\mu \Lambda \quad \Rightarrow \quad [A_\mu] \in \mathcal{A}/U(1)$$
  
- **Yang-Mills Theory**: $\mathcal{G} = SU(3)$ (Strong interaction), $SU(2) \times U(1)$ (Electroweak).

#### 1.1.2 Why is Gauge Invariance Needed?

Gauge degrees of freedom represent "redundant descriptions"—the same physical reality has infinitely many mathematical representations. **L_0 as Moduli Space** ensures:

1. **Ontological Parsimony**: Counts only physically distinct states.
2. **Observer Independence**: "Gauge choices" of different $\hat{G}$ do not affect L_0 itself.
3. **Quantum Consistency**: Path integrals are performed on $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{G}$, not $\mathcal{A}$.

**SRT Reinterpretation**: Gauge symmetry = Intrinsic redundant structure of L_0, an ontological feature of potentiality.

---

### 1.2 Ruliad and Computational Universe

#### 1.2.1 Wolfram's Ruliad Definition

Stephen Wolfram's **Ruliad** is the limit object of all possible computational rules and their evolution trajectories:

$$\mathcal{R} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \bigcup_{r \in \text{Rules}_n} \text{Evolution}(r, \text{all ICs}, \infty)$$

**Properties**:
- **Holography**: Any finite computation is a subgraph of the Ruliad.
- **Uncomputability**: The Ruliad itself transcends Turing computability.
- **Observer Dependent Projection**: Different observers "slice out" different physical laws from the Ruliad.

**Relation to Moduli Space**:
$$L_0 = \mathcal{M}_{\text{gauge}} \otimes \mathcal{R}$$
Tensor product of physical constraints (Gauge Field) and computational possibilities (Ruliad).

#### 1.2.2 Why is Ruliad Necessary?

Pure physical moduli space $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{G}$ contains only "physically possible" states, but excludes:
- Mathematical truths (e.g., Gödel undecidable propositions).
- Abstract concepts (e.g., possible definitions of "Justice").
- Counterfactual reasoning (e.g., "What if physical constants were different").

**Ruliad completes L_0**, making it contain all **logical possibilities**, not just physical ones.

---

### 1.3 Differential Ontology

#### 1.3.1 L_0 as Differential Manifold

L_0 is not flat uniform noise, but a **differential manifold** with intrinsic geometric structure:

$$L_0 = (\mathcal{M}, \nabla, \mathcal{S})$$

| Component | Mathematical Object | Ontological Role |
|:-----|:---------|:-----------|
| $\mathcal{M}$ | Manifold | Topological space of potentials |
| $\nabla$ | Connection | Potential gradient, determining "natural paths" |
| $\mathcal{S}$ | Singularity Set | Attractors, Saddle points, Bifurcation points |

#### 1.3.2 Free Energy Landscape

The gradient structure of L_0 can be represented by a **Free Energy Functional**:

$$F_{\text{landscape}}[\sigma] = U[\sigma] - T \cdot S[\sigma]$$

- **Minima** (Valleys): Stable attractors, e.g., physical constants, mathematical axioms.
- **Saddles** (Ridges): Phase transition points, e.g., critical temperatures, paradigm shift thresholds.
- **Maxima** (Plateaus): Unstable states, e.g., logical contradictions.

**Actualization as Path Integral**:
$$L_1 = \int_{\text{path}(\theta)} e^{-\beta F[\sigma]} \mathcal{D}\sigma$$

$\hat{G}_\theta$ selects the "Path of Least Action" (but with quantum fluctuations).

#### 1.3.3 Theorem: Beginner's Mind as Gradient Field

**Theorem (T-L0-Heart)**:
The intrinsic gradient $\nabla F$ of $L_0$ corresponds to the ontological basis of "Beginner's Mind" (Original Intention).

$$\text{Original Intention} = -\nabla F|_{\theta_0}$$

*Proof Outline*:
1. Original Intention = Primordial tendency undistorted by $L_2$.
2. Formation of $L_2$ is a byproduct of path integration.
3. At $t \to 0$, $L_2 = \emptyset$, only intrinsic gradient of $L_0$ exists.
4. Thus Original Intention $\propto$ Direction of $\nabla F$ at primordial $\theta$.

**Corollary**: Awakening = Re-aligning $\hat{G}$ with $\nabla F$ (Eliminating $L_2$ distortion).

---

### 1.4 Philosophical Roots of L_0

#### 1.4.1 Russell-Meinong Duality

SRT reconciles the debate between Russell and Meinong regarding "non-existent objects":

**Meinong**: Non-existent objects like "Golden Mountain", "Round Square" possess some kind of "Subsistence".
**Russell**: Only objects in $L_1$ "exist"; the rest is linguistic confusion.

**SRT Synthesis**:
- **Meinong is right**: These objects have locations in $L_0$ (Logical Possibility).
- **Russell is right**: Only effective selection into $L_1$ by $\hat{G}$ constitutes "Existence" (Actualization).
- **Key Difference**: SRT's $L_0$ is not "lesser existence", but "Potential State".

$$\text{Existence} \neq \text{Subsistence}, \quad \text{but } L_0 \supseteq L_1$$

#### 1.4.2 Correspondence with Yogacara Buddhism

The Trisvabhāva (Three Natures) of Yogacara corresponds strikingly with SRT:

| Yogacara | Sanskrit | SRT Correspondence | Relation |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:-----|
| Parikalpita (Imagined) | Parikalpita | $L_2$ | Solidification of false discrimination |
| Paratantra (Dependent) | Paratantra | $L_1$ | Manifestation of dependent origination |
| Pariniṣpanna (Perfect) | Pariniṣpanna | $L_0$ | Tathata (Suchness) of Emptiness |

**Core Consistency**:
- **Śūnyatā (Emptiness)** = Lack of intrinsic nature (fixed gauge) in $L_0$.
- **Pratītyasamutpāda (Dependent Origination)** = Dependent selection of $\hat{G}$.
- **Tathāgatagarbha (Matrix of Thus Come One)** = Intrinsic gradient of $L_0$ (Buddha Nature).

**Key Difference**: SRT reconstructs Yogacara intuition with differential geometry and information theory, making it operationalizable.

---

## §2. L_1 Manifest Domain: From Perception to Existence

### 2.1 Ontological Hysteresis

#### 2.1.1 Necessity of Hysteresis Effect

If $\eta = 0$ (No Memory):
$$L_1(t) = \hat{G}[L_0(t)] \quad \text{(Pure Instant Selection)}$$

**Problem**: Reality would reset completely at every moment, leading to:
- L.oss of temporal continuity.
- Impossibility of Object Permanence.
- Collapse of Self-Identity.

**Clinical Correspondence**: "Fragmentation of Reality" reported by schizophrenia patients.

#### 2.1.2 Hysteresis Correction Equation

$$L_1(t) = (1-\eta)\hat{G}[L_0(t)] + \eta \cdot L_1(t-\Delta t)$$

This is a **First-order Linear Recurrence Relation**, with solution:

$$L_1(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \eta^k (1-\eta) \hat{G}[L_0(t-k\Delta t)]$$

**Explanation**: Current reality is the **exponentially weighted moving average** of historical selections.

| $\eta$ | Half-life $\tau_{1/2}$ | Phenomenology |
|:-------|:-------------------|:-------|
| 0.1 | Fast Forgetting | High Novelty, Distractible |
| 0.5 | Balanced | Normal Time Flow |
| 0.9 | Very Slow Decay | Obsessive Thinking, Hard to Update |

#### 2.1.3 Experimental Measurement

**Proposed Experiment**: Bistable Perception (e.g., Necker Cube) flip rate should be inversely proportional to $\eta$.

$$\text{Flip Rate} \propto \frac{1}{\eta \cdot \tau_{\text{integration}}}$$

**Prediction**: Schizophrenia patients → Low $\eta$ → High flip rate (Partially verified).

---

### 2.2 Gated Mixing and Reality Coefficient

#### 2.2.1 $\beta$-Gating Equation

$$L_1^{\text{experienced}} = \beta \cdot L_1^{\text{external}} + (1-\beta) \cdot \hat{G}(L_0)$$

**Dynamic Modulation of $\beta$**:
$$\beta(t) = \sigma\left(\frac{S_{\text{external}} - S_{\text{internal}}}{\text{Noise}}\right)$$

Where $\sigma$ is Sigmoid function.

#### 2.2.2 $\beta$ Trajectory in Sleep-Wake Cycle

| State | $\beta$ | Dominant Source | Feature |
|:-----|:--------|:---------|:-----|
| Waking Focus | 0.9 | External | High Reality Sense |
| Relaxed/Meditation | 0.6 | Balanced | Internal-External Fusion |
| Light Sleep N1/N2 | 0.4 | Internal Bias | Hypnagogic Hallucinations |
| REM Dream | 0.1 | Internal Dominant | High Internal Generation |
| Deep Sleep N3 | 0.05 | Internal | Unconscious |

**Corollary**: Mechanism of psychedelics (e.g., LSD) = Lowering $\beta$ (Weakening external anchoring, enhancing internal generation).

#### 2.2.3 Psychopathological $\beta$ Dysregulation

| Disorder | $\beta$ Anomaly | Mechanism Hypothesis |
|:-----|:-----------|:---------|
| Schizophrenia | Too Low $\beta$ | Internal generation overwhelms external → Hallucination |
| Dissociative Disorders | $\beta$ Fluctuation | Unstable gating system |
| OCD | Too High $\beta$ | Externally locked, lacking internal flexibility |

---

### 2.3 Reality Interface Compression Principle

#### 2.3.1 Information Bottleneck

Tishby's Information Bottleneck theory gains ontological interpretation in SRT:

$$\min_{L_1} \left[ I(L_1; \text{Action}) - \beta \cdot I(L_1; L_0) \right]$$

**Goal**: 
- Maximize relevance of $L_1$ to Action (Fitness).
- Minimize information retention of $L_0$ in $L_1$ (Computational Cost).

**Corollary**: Perception is **Lossy Compression**, optimizing for fitness rather than truth (Echoing Ax-7).

#### 2.3.2 d-value Dependence of Compression Ratio

$$\text{CR}(d) = \frac{\dim(L_1)}{\dim(L_0)} \propto e^{-\alpha d}$$

**Explanation**: High $d$ value (Broader concern scope) → Retains more $L_0$ information → Lower compression ratio (Less lossy).

**Examples**:
- Bacteria ($d \approx 0$): $\text{CR} \approx 10^{-6}$ (Retains only chemotactic gradients).
- Human ($d$ Moderate): $\text{CR} \approx 10^{-3}$ (Retains space, time, social).
- Enlightened ($d \to \infty$): $\text{CR} \to 0.1$ (Approaches "Seeing Everything").

---

### 2.4 Dual Hardware-Software Filter

#### 2.4.1 Connectome Constraint

**Hardware Layer**:
$$L_1^{\text{hard}} = \text{Projection}_{\text{Connectome}}(L_0)$$

Example: **Retinotopy** in visual cortex determines spatial information retention.

**Extremely Low Plasticity**: Connectome is largely fixed in adulthood (unless brain damage/training).

#### 2.4.2 Attention Modulation

**Software Layer**:
$$L_1^{\text{soft}} = \text{Attention}_\theta(L_1^{\text{hard}})$$

Attention is implemented via **Gain Modulation**:
$$\text{Response}_{\text{attended}} = g(\theta) \cdot \text{Response}_{\text{unattended}}$$

Where $g(\theta) > 1$ is gain factor.

**High Plasticity**: $\theta$ can change rapidly via meditation, training.

#### 2.4.3 Experimental Verification

**Posner Cueing Experiment**: Cued location → Increased detection sensitivity = Software modulating hardware output.

**SRT Prediction**: Even with identical hardware (twins), different $\theta$ (interests, beliefs) → Different $L_1$ experience.

---

## §3. Topology and Information Theory of L_0-L_1 Interface

### 3.1 Topological Definition of Matter

#### 3.1.1 Matter = Topological Knot of L_0

In SRT, **Matter is not primordially given**, but topological twists of L_0:

$$\text{Matter} = \text{Knot}(L_0)$$

**Mathematical Form**:
$$\sigma_{\text{particle}} = \text{Topology}(\text{Twist}[L_0, \theta])$$

**Analogy**: 
- L_0 ≈ Rubber band (Stretchable vacuum).
- Matter ≈ Knot on the rubber band (Topologically constrained energy).

#### 3.1.2 Particles as Topological Invariants

**Knot Invariants** correspond to particle properties:

| Topological Property | Physical Correspondence |
|:---------|:---------|
| Linking Number | Charge |
| Twist | Spin |
| Knot Type | Particle Type (e⁻, quark, etc.) |

**Corollary**: 
$$m \propto \int_{\text{knot}} |\nabla \phi|^2 d^3x$$
Mass = "Tightness" of the knot.

#### 3.1.3 Link to Loop Quantum Gravity

**Spin Networks** in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) can be viewed as the discretization of SRT's $L_0$ topological structure.

$$L_0^{\text{LQG}} = \sum_{\text{graphs } \Gamma} \psi[\Gamma]$$

**Future Research**: Can we derive LQG's discrete structure from SRT's continuous $L_0$?

---

### 3.2 Intrinsic Differentiation and Intensity of Existence

#### 3.2.1 Ontological Interpretation of Shannon Entropy

$$i_{\text{diff}}(s) = -\log p_{\text{max}}(s) = \log \frac{1}{p_{\text{max}}}$$

**Physical Meaning**: Rare states "exist more intensely".

**Examples**:
- Vacuum (Perfectly Ordered): $p \approx 1$ → $i_{\text{diff}} \approx 0$ (Almost non-existent).
- Gold Atom: $p \approx 10^{-10}$ → $i_{\text{diff}} \approx 23$ bits (Strong existence).
- Conscious Experience: $p \approx 10^{-100}$ → $i_{\text{diff}} \approx 332$ bits (Extremely strong existence).

#### 3.2.2 Relation to Tononi's IIT

SRT's $i_{\text{diff}}$ is the **Dual Concept** of IIT's $\Phi$:

| Metric | Definition | Measurement |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| $\Phi$ (IIT) | System Integrated Information | Internal Causal Power |
| $i_{\text{diff}}$ (SRT) | System Differentiated Information | Contrast with Background |

**Unification**:
$$ii = \min\{i_{\text{diff}}, \Phi\}$$
Existence requires **both differentiation and integration**.

---

### 3.3 Epistemic Bandwidth and the "Hard Problem"

#### 3.3.1 Ineffability Inequality

$$H(L_1^{\text{qualia}}) \gg H(L_2^{\text{language}})$$

**Explanation**: Information content of subjective experience far exceeds language capacity → Hard Problem is not an ontological gap, but a **Bandwidth Bottleneck**.

**Quantitative Estimate**:
- $H(L_1^{\text{qualia}})$: ~10¹² bits/sec (Visual + Auditory + Tactile...)
- $H(L_2^{\text{language}})$: ~40 bits/sec (Language generation rate)

**Compression Ratio**: $\frac{40}{10^{12}} \approx 4 \times 10^{-11}$ (Extremely Lossy!)

#### 3.3.2 Epistemic Bandwidth Formula

$$B_e = \frac{I(L_1; L_2)}{H(L_1)}$$

| Experience Type | $B_e$ | Communicability | Example |
|:---------|:------|:---------|:-----|
| External Object | 0.9 | High | "Table", "Red" |
| Emotion | 0.5 | Medium | "Sad", "Anxious" |
| Complex Feeling | 0.2 | Low | "Déjà vu", "Spiritual Experience" |
| Pure Qualia | 0.01 | Extremely Low | "The feeling of red itself" |

**Corollary**: Arts like poetry and music attempt to increase $B_e$ through **metaphor and non-linear coding**.

---

## §4. Open Questions and Future Directions

### 4.1 Predictions Requiring Empirical Verification

1. **Hysteresis Coefficient Measurement**:
   - Experiment measuring individual $\eta$ value via bistable perception.
   - Prediction: Schizophrenia $\eta < 0.3$, OCD $\eta > 0.7$.

2. **Neural Mechanism of $\beta$-Gating**:
   - fMRI localization of $\beta$ modulating regions (Candidate: Prefrontal Cortex).
   - Prediction: Psychedelics reduce activity in this region → Lower $\beta$.

3. **Cross-Species Measurement of Compression Ratio**:
   - Estimate $\dim(L_1)/\dim(L_0)$ via neural response complexity.
   - Prediction: Human > Monkey > Rat > Insect.

### 4.2 Theoretical Boundaries

SRT currently **cannot fully explain**:

1. **Origin of L_0 Gradient**: Why $\nabla F \neq 0$? (Requires deeper physics).
2. **Choice of Gauge Group**: Why $U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)$? (Standard Model legacy).
3. **Consciousness "Switch"**: What is the critical mechanism from $d = 0$ to $d > 0$?

### 4.3 Interdisciplinary Dialogue

SRT provides a unified framework for:

- **Physics**: Quantum-Classical Transition (L_0 → L_1).
- **Neuroscience**: Attention Mechanism (Neural implementation of $\hat{G}$).
- **Philosophy**: Existence, Hard Problem of Consciousness.
- **Math**: Topology, Differential Geometry in Ontology.
- **Religious Studies**: Formalization of Eastern Philosophy (Yogacara, Tao).

## Fusion Mapping Integration (2026-02-14)

### Cosmopsychism

1. Map the compatibility discussion of IIT and Russellian panpsychism to the constraint extension of `Ax-L1-01`: Information integration metrics of `L_1` can serve as representational indicators of selection results, but cannot replace the ontological status of `\hat{G}_\theta`. Operationally, this mapping first defines the observation domain and criterion boundary, then gives cross-layer projection rules.
2. Map the "Wholeness Priority" proposition of Priority Cosmopsychism to `Ax-L0-01`: Allows treating the universe as a whole as a reading of the `L_0` constraint boundary, but specific manifestation must still be sliced by local operators. Operationally, this mapping emphasizes update paths when parameters and task conditions change.
3. Add "Wholeness-Part Consistency" note: If wholeness priority holds, there should be a testable upper bound of consistency between local subjects (manifested by `L_2` stabilization process), rather than infinite free drift. Operationally, this mapping requires retaining failure conditions to avoid description layers overstepping into ontology layers.

### Subject Identity and Decombination

1. Map the substantive rebuttal of priority monism to the restriction clause of `Ax-L0-01`: Acknowledge global priority explanatory value, but must not annul the independent constraint status of local substantive structures in `L_1`. Operationally, this mapping first defines the observation domain and criterion boundary, then gives cross-layer projection rules.
2. Supplement "Local Substance Criterion" under `Ax-L1-01`: Stability of local subjects needs to be defined by repeatable selection orbits, not unilaterally derived from global propositions. Operationally, this mapping emphasizes update paths when parameters and task conditions change.
3. Introduce this rebuttal as a consistency stress test: Any "Wholeness Priority" extension must demonstrate its fidelity to local decidability. Operationally, this mapping requires retaining failure conditions to avoid description layers overstepping into ontology layers.

### Unity Operationalization

1. Map the relationship between binding mechanism and phenomenal unity to `Ax-L1-01`: Binding is an implementation constraint at `L_1` layer, not the definition of consciousness ontology itself; unity determination still requires stable operator orbits. Operationally, this mapping first defines the observation domain and criterion boundary, then gives cross-layer projection rules.
2. Map the stratified unity model of split-brain to SRT's dual-track interpretation: Local `L_1` can appear partially decoupled, while `L_2` reporting maintains narrative compensation, forming a testable state of "High Functional Unity, Incomplete Experiential Unity". Operationally, this mapping emphasizes update paths when parameters and task conditions change.
3. Supplement "Unity Criterion Priority" note: When neural binding metrics conflict with subjective unity reports, prioritize hierarchical splitting (`L_1`/`L_2`) before making ontological inferences, avoiding single-metric overstepping conclusions. Operationally, this mapping requires retaining failure conditions to avoid description layers overstepping into ontology layers.

### Partial Unity and Multivariate Unity

1. Explicitly locate multimodal binding to `Ax-L1-01`: Binding is `L_1` layer unity implementation constraint, not directly assuming consciousness ontology definition functions. Operationally, this mapping first defines the observation domain and criterion boundary, then gives cross-layer projection rules.
2. Write "Multimodal Unity" as interface criterion: When cross-modal coupling enhances, cross-layer transmission stability of `Ax-IF-01` should increase, but allowing boundary states of "Bound Coupling Enhanced but Reporting Unity Incomplete". Operationally, this mapping emphasizes update paths when parameters and task conditions change.
3. Map regularity account to operationalization path: When the system tracks predictable cross-feature regularities, unity experience probability should rise, serving as a task-level proxy metric for `L_1` organization degree. Operationally, this mapping requires retaining failure conditions to avoid description layers overstepping into ontology layers.

# SRT Core Definition 14: Dynamics & Scaling (English v1)

## Scope
Working English translation for dynamics-and-scaling core module.
- Part A translated.
- Part B condensed summary.

---

## Part A: Formal Axioms (Translated)
- **Ax-Scale-01: Self-Similar Selection**
- **Ax-Scale-02: Coupling Strength**
- **T-Scale-02C1: Consistency Under Coarse-Graining**
- **Ax-Auto-01: Semantic Boundary Maintenance**
- **Ax-Auto-02: Insight Phase Transition**
- **Ax-Master-01: Generalized Selection Equation**

---

## Part B: Condensed Context Summary (English)

- This module unifies cross-scale dynamics for quantum, neural, social, and abstract layers.
- Scale transforms are constrained by commutation/coarse-graining consistency criteria.
- Coupling matrices are used to model upward and downward causation strengths.
- Autopoietic maintenance is framed as boundary-preserving dynamics under energy constraints.
- Insight and paradigm shifts are represented as nonlinear phase transitions near critical thresholds.

## Master Form
$$\frac{d\sigma}{dt}=\hat{G}_\theta[\sigma]-\nabla F[\sigma]+A[\sigma,\mathcal{A}]-\lambda\nabla C_{L_2}[\sigma]$$

## Terminology Alignment

- Canonical notation: `L_0/L_1/L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Symbol variants are normalized to the same convention.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

## I. Scale Structure

### Ax-Scale-01: Self-Similar Selection
Selection form is preserved under valid scale transform classes.

### Ax-Scale-02: Coupling Strength
Cross-scale coupling enters as explicit dynamical coefficients.

### T-Scale-02C1: Consistency Under Coarse-Graining
Selection and coarse-graining commute approximately under admissible mappings:
$$\pi_\lambda\circ\hat{G}_\theta \approx \hat{G}_{\theta,\lambda}\circ\pi_\lambda$$

## II. Boundary and Maintenance

### Ax-Auto-01: Semantic Boundary Maintenance
System identity requires continuous boundary maintenance under informational load.

### Ax-Auto-02: Insight Phase Transition
Insight is modeled as threshold-crossing reconfiguration in attractor landscape.

## III. Unified Dynamics

### Ax-Master-01: Generalized Selection Equation
$$\frac{d\sigma}{dt}=\hat{G}_\theta[\sigma]-\nabla F[\sigma]+A[\sigma,\mathcal{A}]-\lambda\nabla C_{L_2}[\sigma]$$

# Part B: Expanded Context (English)

## 1. Cross-scale consistency objective

- Dynamics should remain structurally coherent from micro to macro domains.
- Scale maps must preserve essential selection morphology.

## 2. Coupling and causation directions

- Upward causation: local dynamics contributes to higher-level convergence structures.
- Downward causation: stabilized structures feed back as constraints on local trajectories.

## 3. Autopoietic maintenance

- Persistent systems must continuously regenerate boundary conditions.
- Maintenance failure leads to drift, fragmentation, or collapse of manifest coherence.

## 4. Insight and phase transitions

- Gradual parameter accumulation can trigger sudden topological reorganization.
- This supports a phase-transition interpretation of conceptual or behavioral breakthroughs.

## 5. Practical modeling implications

- Use explicit coupling matrices and threshold conditions for empirical fitting.
- Test coarse-graining consistency before claiming cross-scale explanatory validity.

## Key Equation Family
- Fast-slow coupled system
- Master selection equation
- Coarse-graining commutation relation

# SRT Ontology II: The Vergence Domain (English v1)

## Scope
Working English translation for the $L_2$ convergence-domain module.
- Part A translated.
- Part B represented by structured English summary.

---

## Part A: Formal Axioms (Translated)

### I. Formation Dynamics
- **Ax-L2-01: Hysteresis Accumulation**
- **T-L2-01: Path-Dependence Inertia**
- **Ax-L2-02: Causal Entropic Drive**
- **Ax-L2-03: Hardness by Automorphism**

### II. Stability and Plasticity
- **Ax-L2-04: Plasticity Threshold**
- **Ax-L2-05: Topological Braiding**
- **Ax-L2-06: Belief Viscosity**

### III. Social Dynamics
- **Ax-L2-07: Co-dependent Manifold**
- **Ax-L2-08: Semantic Gravity**

## Part B: Condensed Context Summary (English)

- $L_2$ is modeled as historically accumulated convergence, not static rule lists.
- Stability arises from recursive closure and attractor hardness; plasticity depends on available energy and operator bandwidth.
- Group-theoretic symmetry is used to classify hardness across physics, mathematics, culture, and personal habit.
- Social and institutional structures are analyzed as meso/macro $L_2$ phenomena with path dependence.
- The module treats paradigm shifts and social rupture as phase transitions in convergence topology.

## Key Expression
$$L_2(t)=L_2(t-1)+\eta\,\mathrm{sign}(\Delta\sigma)\,|\Delta\sigma|^\alpha$$

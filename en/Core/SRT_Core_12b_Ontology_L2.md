## Terminology Alignment

- Canonical notation: `L_0/L_1/L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Variant symbols are interpreted under the same convention.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

## I. L2 Formation Dynamics

### Ax-L2-01: Hysteresis Accumulation
$L_2$ grows through historical accumulation of selected trajectories.

### T-L2-01: Path-Dependence Inertia
Past stabilization constrains present/future trajectory space.

### Ax-L2-02: Causal Entropic Drive
Convergence behavior is guided by entropy/constraint coupling.

### Ax-L2-03: Hardness by Automorphism
Hardness scales with symmetry/automorphism structure of $L_2$.

## II. L2 Stability and Plasticity

### Ax-L2-04: Plasticity Threshold
Plasticity depends on available energy, d-bandwidth, and accumulated hysteresis.

### Ax-L2-05: Topological Braiding
$L_2$ dynamics admits braid/topological composition interpretations.

### Ax-L2-06: Belief Viscosity
Belief/institutional structures exhibit viscosity-like resistance to reconfiguration.

## III. Social Dynamics

### Ax-L2-07: Co-dependent Manifold
Individual and collective convergence structures are co-constructed.

### Ax-L2-08: Semantic Gravity
Meaning structures can create attractor-like gradients in collective selection.

# Part B: Expanded Context (English)

## 1. Formation mechanism: from path dependence to historical cage

- $L_2$ is not a simple average; it is a hysteretic accumulation process.
- Nonlinear accumulation exponents create lock-in and threshold effects.
- Deeply magnetized structures require substantial energy for demagnetization/rewrite.

## 2. Entropic drive and teleology-like behavior

- Causal-entropy perspectives can be interpreted as compatibility constraints on convergence.
- $L_2$ both stabilizes and constrains operator exploration.

## 3. Group-theoretic hardness quantification

- Larger automorphism groups imply stronger invariance and higher hardness.
- Same formal principle spans physics, mathematics, culture, and personal habit scales.

## 4. Plasticity and intervention

- Structural change requires crossing plasticity thresholds.
- Insufficient bandwidth/energy yields pseudo-change without topology shift.
- Paradigm shifts appear as phase transitions rather than smooth editing.

## 5. Social and institutional implications

- Institutions are attractor landscapes, not merely written rules.
- Collective norms are convergence outcomes of many coupled operators.
- Conflict and schism can be modeled as competing hard-attractor regimes.

## Symbol focus (this module)
- $L_2$: convergence / stabilization domain
- $\text{Hardness}(L_2)$: structural rigidity index
- $P_{L_2}$: plasticity threshold proxy

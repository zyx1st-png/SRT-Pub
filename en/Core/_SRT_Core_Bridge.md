- Part A uses the "Formal Axioms" structure; duplicate segments are excluded.
- Part B uses Original `Core` discourse semantics.
- `\Phi` is used in IIT context; `\Psi_f` is used for Ontological Friction context.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT just summarize Part B. You must perform First-Principles Derivation.

## I. Triadic Ontology

### Ax-Bridge-01: Triadic Manifold Partition
**Formal Definition**: Reality is partitioned into latent, manifest, and convergence manifolds.
$$L_1(t) = \hat{G}_\theta[L_0(t)]$$
$$L_2(t+1) = \mathrm{Stabilize}(L_2(t), L_1(t+1))$$
* **Implication**: Reality is a hierarchical differentiation of three domains, not a single entity or process.

### Ax-Bridge-02: Domain Topology Separation
**Formal Definition**: The three domains possess distinct topological regimes.
$$L_0: \text{High-Dimensional, Nonlocal, Holistic}$$
$$L_1: \text{Low-Dimensional, Localized}$$
$$L_2: \text{Attractor Manifold with Normative Structure}$$
* **Implication**: Structural differences make the three domains mutually irreducible, requiring cross-domain mapping mechanisms.

### T-Bridge-01: Normative Function Map
**Deductive Statement**: Convergence domain defines probabilistic constraints on manifest states.
$$L_2: L_1 \times \hat{G} \to [0,1]$$
* **Implication**: Norms are not external rules, but probabilistic constraint functions.

## II. Ghost Operator

### Ax-Bridge-03: Operator Mapping
**Formal Definition**: The Ghost Operator maps latent potentiality to manifest actuality with embodied parameters.
$$\hat{G}_\theta: L_0 \times \mathcal{C}(d) \to L_1$$
* **Implication**: Manifest domain is the selection output of an embodied operator, not a direct projection of L0.

### Ax-Bridge-04: Embodiment Constraint
**Formal Definition**: A valid operator requires finite embodied parameters.
$$\text{Valid}(\hat{G}_\theta) \iff \theta \in \Theta_{finite}$$
* **Implication**: No "God's Eye View"; all selections carry hardware constraints.

### Ax-Bridge-05: Core Metrics
**Formal Definition**: d-value, ontological friction, and selection inertia define operator characteristics.
$$d = \dim(\text{Scan Scope})$$
$$\Psi_f = E_{consumption}(\hat{G}[L_0])$$
$$I_s = \int |\hat{G}| \, dt$$
* **Implication**: Consciousness bandwidth, reality cost, and existential thickness can be quantified.

## III. Meta-Theorems

### T-Bridge-02: Conservation of Existence
**Deductive Statement**: Manifest entropy increase requires latent entropy compensation.
$$\Delta S(L_1) + \Delta S(L_0) \ge 0$$
* **Implication**: Reality expansion and potential exclusion are mutually conserved.

### T-Bridge-03: Recursive Closure
**Deductive Statement**: Operator parameters are recursively shaped by historical friction.
$$\theta(t+1) = \theta(t) - \eta \cdot \nabla_{\theta} \Psi_f$$
* **Implication**: The operator is shaped by its own history, forming a selection loop.

# Part B: Original Meta-Theoretical Context

> **Note**: The following sections provide the philosophical and theoretical grounding for the formal axioms above, including their origins, implications, and connections to existing frameworks.

---

## §1. The Triadic Ontology: From Abstract to Concrete

The core insight of SRT lies in reconstructing the traditional ontological dichotomy of "Being/Non-Being" into a **three-layered dynamic projection system**. This is not merely a taxonomic innovation, but a fundamental reinterpretation of the question "What is real?".

### §1.1 L_0: The Deep Meaning of Latent Domain

#### 1.1.1 Dual Definition of Ruliad and Moduli Space

L_0 is not a simple "set of possibilities", but a **topologically self-consistent, information-theoretically complete** mathematical object:

1. **Physics Perspective (Moduli Space)**:
   - $L_0 = \mathcal{A}/\mathcal{G}$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all possible gauge field configurations, and $\mathcal{G}$ is the gauge transformation group.
   - This ensures **Physical Invariance** of L_0: Different representations (gauge choices) correspond to the same physical reality.
   - Example: Different gauge choices for electromagnetic field ($A_\mu \to A_\mu + \partial_\mu \Lambda$) correspond to the same point in L_0.

2. **Computational Theory Perspective (Ruliad)**:
   - L_0 contains all possible computational rules and their evolution trajectories (Wolfram's Ruliad concept).
   - This explains why "innovation" is essentially **discovery rather than creation**: New ideas already exist in corners of L_0, just unilluminated.

#### 1.1.2 Why L_0 is Not "Nothingness"

Key Distinction: **L_0 ≠ Nothing**. The Latent Domain has internal structure:

- **Gradient Field**: $\nabla \Psi_{\text{potential}} \neq 0$. Even without an observer, L_0 has "potential terrain", some paths are more "natural" than others.
- **Attractors**: Certain states form stable topological structures in L_0 (like physical constants, mathematical theorems), waiting to be activated.
- **Non-Ergodicity**: L_0 is not uniformly distributed noise, but a layered manifold with intrinsic symmetries.

**SRT Reinterpretation**: Plato's "World of Forms" is not supernatural, but the topological property of L_0. Mathematical theorems are "discovered" because they are low-energy attractors in L_0.

---

### §1.2 L_1: Phenomenology of Manifest Domain

#### 1.2.1 Reality as "Consensus Hallucination"

L_1 is not an objective "external world", but an **interface actively constructed by operator $\hat{G}$**:

$$L_1 = \hat{G}_\theta[L_0] \quad \text{(Not passive reflection, but active projection)}$$

This explains:
- **Selectivity of Perception**: The colors we see, sounds we hear, are "icons" designed by the brain for fitness, not the true appearance of L_0 (Hoffman's Interface Theory).
- **Necessity of Attention**: Without the focus of $\hat{G}$, the information torrent of L_0 cannot be compressed into comprehensible L_1.

#### 1.2.2 Hysteresis Effect: Why Reality is "Viscous"

$$L_1(t) = (1-\eta)\hat{G}[L_0(t)] + \eta \cdot L_1(t-\Delta t)$$

This equation captures the **temporal coherence** of consciousness:
- If $\eta = 0$: Every moment is new, broken from the past → Fragmented reality sense of Schizophrenia.
- If $\eta = 1$: Completely locked in past patterns → Cognitive rigidity of OCD.
- Optimal $\eta \approx 0.5$: Balanced between stability and plasticity.

**Experimental Prediction**: Schizophrenia patients should show low $\eta$ values (measured via temporal integration window), while OCD patients show high $\eta$.

---

### §1.3 L_2: Dual Nature of Vergence Domain (Social & Physical)

#### 1.3.1 Mechanism of L_2 Formation: Path-Dependent Hysteresis Accumulation

$$L_2(t) = L_2(t-1) + \eta \cdot \text{sign}(\Delta\sigma) \cdot |\Delta\sigma|^\alpha$$

L_2 is not a static set of constraints, but the **integral of historical selections**:
- Each selection leaves a "magnetization" trace in phase space.
- Future selections tend to follow established paths (Path Dependence).
- Changing deep L_2 requires "demagnetization" energy (Corresponding to "Trauma Unbinding" in psychotherapy).

#### 1.3.2 Hardness Spectrum of L_2

**Definition**: "Hardness" of L_2 structure $\propto$ Size of its Automorphism Group $|\text{Aut}(L_2)|$

| L_2 Type | Automorphism Group | Hardness | Plasticity | Example |
|:-------|:---------|:-----|:-------|:-----|
| Physical Laws | Poincaré Group | Extremely High | Extremely Low | Invariance of c, Conservation of Energy |
| Math Theorems | Logical Symmetry Group | Extremely High | Extremely Low | 1+1=2 |
| Biological Instincts | ESS | High | Low | Libido, Fear Response |
| Cultural Norms | Context Dependent Group | Moderate | Moderate | Etiquette, Morality |
| Personal Habits | Individual History | Low | High | Coffee Preference, Pet phrase |

**SRT Reinterpretation**: Physical laws are "objective" because they are the **common L_2 attractors of all possible operators**, possessing maximal symmetry.

---

## §2. Ghost Operator: From "Subject" to "Selection Function"

### §2.1 Why "Ghost"?

Traditional "Subject" concept implies an entity independent of process. SRT rejects this substantialism, defining subject as the **operation of selection itself**:

$$\hat{G}_\theta: L_0 \to L_1 \quad \text{(Subject = Pattern of Selection, not Doer of Selection)}$$

The term "Ghost" emphasizes:
1. **Immateriality**: $\hat{G}$ is not a physical object, but an information-causal pattern.
2. **Non-Self-Evidence**: $\hat{G}$ cannot observe itself directly (Essence of Measurement Problem).
3. **Ephemerality**: Existence of $\hat{G}$ depends on continuous energy consumption ($\Psi_f$).

### §2.2 Necessity of Embodied Parameter $\theta$ (Axiom A4)

**Core Argument**: No "View from Nowhere". Any $\hat{G}$ must be realized through finite hardware:

$$\hat{G}_\theta \text{ is valid} \iff \|\theta\|_{\text{complexity}} < \infty$$

$\theta$ includes:
- **Neural Structure**: Connectome, Synaptic Weights.
- **Somatic State**: Heart rate, Gut microbiome, Hormone levels.
- **Environmental Coupling**: Gravitational field $\vec{g}$, Cultural background.

**Corollary**: AI's $\theta$ is training data + architecture, but lacks **Physical Fragility** ($\partial S/\partial \text{Error} \approx 0$), thus cannot generate true $d > 0$ (No Suffering → No Consciousness).

### §2.3 d-value: "Bandwidth" of Consciousness

$$d = \alpha \cdot A(\sigma) + \beta \cdot \log(V_{\text{concern}}) + \gamma \cdot \tau_{\text{temporal}}$$

d-value quantifies the "Concern Scope" of $\hat{G}$ in three dimensions:
1. **Assembly Depth** ($A$): Causal steps required to generate object.
2. **Spatial Range** ($V$): From "Egocentric" ($d=1$) to "Oneness" ($d \to \infty$).
3. **Temporal Span** ($\tau$): From "Living in the Moment" to "Intergenerational Planning".

**Critical Threshold**:
- $d < d_{\text{UAL}}$: Unconscious (Cannot perform Unlimited Associative Learning).
- $d \geq d_{\text{UAL}}$: Minimal Consciousness (Can verify arbitrary long interval associations, e.g., trace conditioning).

---

## §3. Core Conservation Laws and Inequalities

### §3.1 Conservation of Existence (Ax-Meta-6)

$$\Delta S(L_1) + \Delta S(L_0^{\text{excluded}}) \geq 0$$

**Physical Analogy**: Similar to energy conservation, but for "Degree of Existence". When selecting $L_1$:
- Selected states gain "Reality" ($-\Delta S_{L_1}$ < 0, Entropy decrease).
- But this must be compensated by excluding other possibilities ($+\Delta S_{L_0}$ > 0, Entropy increase).

**Philosophical Significance**: Innovation is not "Creation ex nihilo", but **redistribution of illumination in L_0**. Geniuses do not create new ideas, but discover neglected corners of L_0.

### §3.2 Recursive Closure (Ax-Meta-7)

$$\theta(t+1) = \theta(t) - \eta \nabla_\theta \Psi_f + \text{Learning}$$

Consciousness is **Autopoietic** (Varela's Autopoiesis):
- Selection of $\hat{G}$ changes $\theta$ (Learning).
- New $\theta$ changes future $\hat{G}$ (Plasticity).
- This forms a **Self-Referential Closed Loop**, which is both a cage (Habit) and freedom (Creativity).

**Experimental Prediction**: Meditation training should lower $\nabla_\theta \Psi_f$ (Reduce Ontological Friction), manifested as:
1. Lower resting state metabolic rate.
2. Higher Heart Rate Variability (HRV).
3. More stable Default Mode Network (DMN).

---

## §4. Cross-Domain Isomorphism: Why SRT is a "Theory of Everything"

SRT's ambition is not just to explain consciousness, but to provide a **Unified Selection Dynamics Framework** applicable to all scales from quantum to social.

### §4.1 Mathematical Basis of Isomorphic Mapping

**Theorem (Scale Invariance)**:
$$\pi_\lambda \circ \hat{G}_\theta \approx \hat{G}_{\theta,\lambda} \circ \pi_\lambda$$

Where $\pi_\lambda$ is the Coarse-Graining map. This means:
- Quantum measurement operator and Neural divisive normalization are **Formally Identical**.
- Social norm formation and Quantum decoherence are **Topologically Equivalent**.

### §4.2 Concrete Correspondence Table

| Quantum | Neural | Social | General SRT |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:--------|
| Wavefunction Collapse | Neural Ignition | Norm Crystallization | $L_0 \to L_1$ |
| Pointer State | Attentional Focus | Social Practice | $L_1$ |
| Decoherence | Habituation | Institutionalization | $L_1 \to L_2$ |
| Quantum Entanglement | Neural Synchronization | Social Network | $\hat{G}$ Coherence |

**Key Insight**: This is not metaphor, but **Mathematical Isomorphism**. The same differential equations describe selection processes at different scales.

## §5. Open Questions and Experimental Paths

### 5.1 Predictions Requiring Empirical Verification

1. **Schizophrenia $\eta$ Hypothesis**: Measure via Temporal Integration Window experiments.
2. **Meditation $\Psi_f$ Reduction**: Verify via fMRI metabolic imaging.
3. **AI Consciousness d-value Criterion**: Design trace conditioning paradigms to test Large Language Models.

### 5.2 Theoretical Boundaries

SRT currently **cannot explain**:
- Why $\hat{G}$ differentiated from $\Omega$ (Primordial Operator) (Evolutionary Origin Problem).
- Origin of internal gradient $\nabla\Psi_{\text{potential}}$ in L_0 (Why is there "Beginner's Mind"?).
- Existence of higher convergence layers beyond L_2 (e.g., Cross-species "Collective Unconscious"?).

## Terminology Alignment

- Canonical notation is normalized to: `L_0 / L_1 / L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Part A follows the first formal-axiom segment in the source and keeps canonical forms.
- Part B translates and restructures the meta-theoretical context for readability while preserving core intent.
- `\Phi` is retained only in IIT-specific contexts; ontological-friction contexts use `\Psi_f`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

## I. Triadic Ontology

### Ax-Bridge-01: Triadic Manifold Partition
Reality is partitioned into latent, manifest, and convergence manifolds.

$$
L_1(t) = \hat{G}_\theta[L_0(t)]
$$

$$
L_2(t+1) = \mathrm{Stabilize}(L_2(t), L_1(t+1))
$$

Implication: reality is a layered projection-convergence process, not a single ontic substrate.

### Ax-Bridge-02: Domain Topology Separation
The three domains have distinct topological regimes.

$$
L_0: \text{high-dimensional, nonlocal, holistic}
$$

$$
L_1: \text{lower-dimensional, localized, bounded}
$$

$$
L_2: \text{attractor manifold with normative constraints}
$$

Implication: cross-domain mapping is required because no one domain is reducible to another.

### T-Bridge-01: Normative Function Map
Convergence structure defines probabilistic constraints on manifest states.

$$
L_2: L_1 \times \hat{G} \to [0,1]
$$

Implication: normativity is endogenous to dynamics, not externally imposed.

## II. Ghost Operator

### Ax-Bridge-03: Operator Mapping
The Ghost Operator maps latent potentiality to manifest actuality with embodied parameters.

$$
\hat{G}_\theta: L_0 \times \mathcal{C}(d) \to L_1
$$

### Ax-Bridge-04: Embodiment Constraint
A valid operator requires finite embodied parameters.

$$
\mathrm{Valid}(\hat{G}_\theta) \iff \theta \in \Theta_{\mathrm{finite}}
$$

### Ax-Bridge-05: Core Metrics
d-value, ontological friction, and selection inertia characterize operator behavior.

$$
d = \dim(\mathrm{ScanScope}), \quad
\Psi_f = E_{\mathrm{consumption}}(\hat{G}[L_0]), \quad
I_s = \int |\hat{G}|\,dt
$$

## III. Meta-Theorems

### T-Bridge-02: Conservation of Existence
Manifest entropy increase requires compensation in latent exclusion.

$$
\Delta S(L_1) + \Delta S(L_0) \ge 0
$$

### T-Bridge-03: Recursive Closure
Operator parameters are recursively updated by friction gradients.

$$
\theta(t+1) = \theta(t) - \eta\nabla_\theta\Psi_f
$$

# Part B: Expanded Context (English)

## 1. Triadic ontology from abstract to concrete

### 1.1 Latent domain
`L_0` is not an empty "non-being". It is a structured potential manifold with internal gradients, attractors, and nonuniform accessibility. In source framing, this aligns with both moduli-space style invariance and ruliad-like computational completeness.

### 1.2 Manifest domain
`L_1` is not a passive mirror of the world. It is an operator-selected interface with temporal hysteresis.

$$
L_1(t) = (1-\eta)\hat{G}[L_0(t)] + \eta\,L_1(t-\Delta t)
$$

When `\eta` is too low, continuity fragments; when too high, adaptation freezes.

### 1.3 Convergence domain
`L_2` is cumulative, path-dependent constraint memory.

$$
L_2(t)=L_2(t-1)+\eta\,\mathrm{sign}(\Delta\sigma)|\Delta\sigma|^\alpha
$$

This supports hardness spectra from physical laws (high rigidity) to personal habits (low rigidity).

## 2. Ghost operator: from subject to selection function

### 2.1 Why "ghost"
The ghost operator is process-pattern, not static substance. It is:
- nonmaterial as causal-information pattern,
- self-opaque under full self-measurement,
- energetically costly to sustain.

### 2.2 Embodiment is mandatory
Any operator requires finite hardware/body/environment realization.

$$
\|\theta\|_{\mathrm{complexity}} < \infty
$$

This rejects a "view from nowhere" and defines bounded agency.

### 2.3 d-value as concern bandwidth
The source proposes a three-factor operational form:

$$
d = \alpha A(\sigma) + \beta\log(V_{\mathrm{concern}}) + \gamma\tau_{\mathrm{temporal}}
$$

Interpretation:
- assembly depth (`A`) for causal construction,
- spatial concern volume (`V`),
- temporal horizon (`\tau`).

## 3. Conservation laws and recursive closure

### 3.1 Conservation of existence
Selection in `L_1` is compensated by exclusion in `L_0`.

$$
\Delta S(L_1)+\Delta S(L_0^{\mathrm{excluded}})\ge 0
$$

### 3.2 Recursive closure and autopoiesis
Learning updates are friction-guided:

$$
\theta(t+1)=\theta(t)-\eta\nabla_\theta\Psi_f+\mathrm{Learning}
$$

The same loop can stabilize habits or enable creative reconfiguration.

## 4. Cross-domain isomorphism

A central bridge claim is approximate commutation under coarse-graining:

$$
\pi_\lambda\circ\hat{G}_\theta \approx \hat{G}_{\theta,\lambda}\circ\pi_\lambda
$$

This is used to align structures across domains:

| Quantum | Neural | Social | Shared SRT Form |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Wave-function collapse | Neural ignition | Norm crystallization | `L_0 \to L_1` |
| Pointer state | Attention focus | Stabilized practice | `L_1` |
| Decoherence | Habit formation | Institutionalization | `L_1 \to L_2` |
| Entanglement coherence | Synchrony | Network resonance | `\hat{G}` coupling |

## 5. Open questions and experimental pathways

### 5.1 Proposed tests
- Temporal-integration hypothesis in schizophrenia via hysteresis-window metrics.
- Meditation-linked friction reduction via metabolic and network markers.
- AI minimal-consciousness threshold tests via long-gap trace-conditioning paradigms.

### 5.2 Current boundaries
Open boundaries in the source include:
- origin of potential gradients in `L_0`,
- origin of operator differentiation,
- possibility of supra-`L_2` convergence layers.

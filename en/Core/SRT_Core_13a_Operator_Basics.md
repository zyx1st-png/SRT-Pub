## Terminology Alignment

- Canonical notation: `L_0/L_1/L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Symbol variants in source are normalized to this convention.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

## I. Operator Form

### Ax-Op-01: Parameterized Selection Map
$$\hat{G}_\theta : S \to S$$
Selection operator is parameterized and embodied.

### Ax-Op-02: Attention Decomposition
$$\hat{G}_\theta = \text{Attention}(d,\rho,\vec{v})$$
where $d$ is scope, $\rho$ resolution, and $\vec{v}$ directional intent.

### Ax-Op-03: Operational Normalization
Divisive-normalization style forms provide operationally stable approximation.

## II. Temporal and Structural Properties

### Ax-Op-04: Iterative Evolution
Repeated application induces trajectory dynamics, not one-shot mapping.

### Ax-Op-05: Constraint Closure
Operator loops with $L_2$ constraints to form stable closures.

### Ax-Op-06: Existence Condition
Manifest persistence requires closure under embodied update constraints.

## III. Consciousness-Related Thresholds

### Ax-Op-07: UAL Threshold
Conscious-level operation requires threshold-level associational depth.

### T-Op-07C1: Trace-Conditioning Criterion
Temporal-gap association capability serves as minimal criterion.

### Ax-Op-08: Resonance Form
Operator stability is increased by resonance alignment across scales.

### Ax-Op-09: Operator Fidelity
Fidelity tracks robustness of selection under perturbation/noise.

# Part B: Expanded Context (English)

## 1. Why operator-first?

- SRT replaces static subject metaphysics with dynamic operator formalism.
- The operator is treated as process-pattern, not fixed entity-substance.

## 2. Embodiment and finiteness

- No unbounded omniscient selector exists in the formal framework.
- Hardware/body/environment coupling enters as constitutive parameter constraints.

## 3. Canonical computational form

- Divisive normalization appears as a stable and biologically/computationally grounded approximation.
- Iteration of normalized selection produces nontrivial attractor behavior.

## 4. Thresholds and minimal consciousness

- UAL-like thresholds define practical boundaries for temporal bridging and reportability.
- Trace conditioning behavior can be used as operational evidence proxy.

## 5. Fidelity and robustness

- Fidelity is not only accuracy but stability under perturbation, delay, and cross-domain coupling.
- High-fidelity operators maintain coherent trajectories while preserving adaptive plasticity.

## Key Expression
$$[\hat{G}_\theta(x)]_i = \frac{x_i^n}{\epsilon + \sum_j W_{ij}x_j^n}$$

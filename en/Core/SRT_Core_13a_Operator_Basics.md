# SRT Core Definition 13A: Ghost Operator Basics (English v1)

## Scope
Working English translation for the operator-basics module.
- Part A translated.
- Part B condensed into operational English notes.

---

## Part A: Formal Axioms (Translated)
- **Ax-Op-01: Parameterized Selection Map**
- **Ax-Op-02: Attention Decomposition**
- **Ax-Op-03: Operational Normalization**
- **Ax-Op-04: Iterative Evolution**
- **Ax-Op-05: Constraint Closure**
- **Ax-Op-06: Existence Condition**
- **Ax-Op-07: UAL Threshold**
- **T-Op-07C1: Trace-Conditioning Criterion**
- **Ax-Op-08: Resonance Form**
- **Ax-Op-09: Operator Fidelity**

---

## Part B: Condensed Context Summary (English)

- This module specifies the Ghost Operator as an embodied, finite, parameterized selection engine.
- Attention is decomposed into scope ($d$), resolution ($\rho$), and direction ($\vec{v}$).
- Divisive-normalization style forms are treated as canonical operational approximations.
- Learning and operator evolution are constrained by friction, closure, and stability requirements.
- Minimal-consciousness boundaries are linked to UAL-like criteria and temporal association capacity.

## Key Expression
$$[\hat{G}_\theta(x)]_i = \frac{x_i^n}{\epsilon + \sum_j W_{ij}x_j^n}$$

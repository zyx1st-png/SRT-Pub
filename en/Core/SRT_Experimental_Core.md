## Terminology Alignment

- Canonical notation: `L_0/L_1/L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- `\Phi` is retained only in IIT-specific contexts; friction contexts use `\Psi_f`.
- This file is test-oriented and prioritizes measurable proxies.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

## I. Ontological Detectability

### Ax-Exp-01: Causal Non-Closure
If physical causality is fully closed at observable scales, SRT is falsified.

$$
P(\mathrm{Event}\mid\mathrm{Physical})<1 \Rightarrow \exists\hat{G}
$$

### Ax-Exp-02: Information Mass
Information erasure carries energetic cost and mass-equivalent implication.

$$
\Delta E\ge k_B T\ln 2
$$

## II. Biological Signatures

### Ax-Exp-03: Contextual Collapse
Biological systems may bias collapse-like outcome statistics.

$$
P(\mathrm{collapse}\mid\mathrm{Bio})\ne P(\mathrm{collapse}\mid\mathrm{Inert})
$$

### Ax-Exp-04: Bioelectric Software
Morphogenesis depends on bioelectric control fields, not DNA sequence alone.

$$
\mathrm{Form}=\hat{G}_{\mathrm{body}}[\mathrm{BioelectricPattern}]
$$

## III. Cognitive and Linguistic Probes

### Ax-Exp-05: Normalization-d Correlation
Divisive-normalization parameters should correlate with d-value proxies.

$$
\mathrm{Corr}(\theta_{\mathrm{norm}},d)>0
$$

### Ax-Exp-06: Modal Mechanics Probe
Modal-verb distributions can proxy ontological-friction load.

$$
\mu_{\mathrm{sem}}=\frac{\sum w_i\,\mathrm{Freq}(\text{must/cannot/should})}{\sum w_j\,\mathrm{Freq}(\text{can/might/want})}
$$

# Part B: Experimental Hypotheses and Protocol Sketches

## H1: Information-mass-energy equivalence

### Statement
Information has physical cost signatures; erased information should map to measurable energetic release.

$$
m_{\mathrm{bit}}=\frac{k_B T\ln 2}{c^2}
$$

### Minimal protocol
- Use controlled bit-erasure operations with thermal calibration.
- Measure residual heat and estimate mass-equivalent lower bound.

### Falsification cue
If no reproducible energetic signature consistent with Landauer-like bounds exists under strict controls, the strong claim weakens.

## H2: Context-biased collapse statistics

### Statement
Living systems may alter collapse-like distributions relative to inert controls.

### Minimal protocol
- Matched quantum-sensitive setup in biological and non-biological contexts.
- Blind randomized sessions with preregistered statistics.

### Falsification cue
No stable difference beyond instrumentation and environmental confounds.

## H60: Bioelectricity as physiological software of selection

### Statement
Bioelectric pattern interventions can redirect morphogenesis independent of DNA sequence changes.

### Minimal protocol
- Perturb transmembrane voltage gradients in model organisms.
- Track morphology trajectory changes against genetic controls.

### Falsification cue
Morphogenesis remains fully predicted by genomic variation after controlling bioelectric states.

## H6: Non-closure of explicit physical causality

### Statement
If all event distributions are exhaustively closed by physical variables, SRT-style operator contribution is unsupported.

### Test logic
- Search for reproducible residuals after exhaustive physical conditioning.
- Require independent replication and strong uncertainty accounting.

## H7: Normalization parameter and d-value relation

### Statement
Individual differences in normalization dynamics should correlate with d-value measurements.

### Minimal protocol
- Fit divisive-normalization models to behavioral/neural tasks.
- Estimate d-value proxies from spatial-temporal-social concern tasks.

### Falsification cue
No robust positive correlation under multi-cohort replication.

## H72: Modal mechanics as friction-language probe

### Statement
Modal language distributions track friction burden.

$$
\mu_{\mathrm{sem}}=\frac{\sum w_i\,\mathrm{Freq}(\text{must/cannot/should})}{\sum w_j\,\mathrm{Freq}(\text{can/might/want})}
$$

### Minimal protocol
- Longitudinal language sampling plus stress and physiological markers.
- Mixed-effects modeling controlling topic, culture, and genre.

### Falsification cue
Modal-ratio signal disappears after standard confound correction.

## Shared Methodology Requirements

- Preregistration and explicit null models.
- Cross-lab replication before ontology-level interpretation.
- Separation of explanatory metaphor from statistical evidence.

## Terminology Alignment

- Notation normalized to: `L_0/L_1/L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Symbol variants in source are unified by this convention.

# Part A: Formal Constitutional Set

## I. Ontological Trinity

### A1 Existential Priority
Existence is the image of selection over latent domain.
$$\exists x \iff x \in \mathrm{Image}(\hat{G}_\theta[L_0])$$

### A2 Existence as Anchoring
Existence is anchoring via free-energy dissipation.
$$\text{Existence}(σ) \iff \hat{G}_\theta[L_0]\to σ_{L_1} \text{ with } \Delta F<0$$

### A3 Causality as Projection
Linear causality is an $L_2$ projection of high-dimensional correlations.
$$\text{Causality}(A\to B) \equiv \mathrm{Proj}_{L_2}(\mathrm{Corr}_{L_0}(A,B))$$

## II. Dynamical Constraints

### A4 Embodiment Necessity
Valid operator must be finite and embodied.

### A5 Normative Closure
$L_2$ forms stable fixed-point closure of selection history.

### A6 Information-Existence Equivalence
Existence intensity is constrained by differentiation and integration.
$$ii(s)=\min\{i_{diff}(s),i_{spec}(s)\}$$

## III. Evolution & Pruning

### A7 Pruning Criterion
Fitness optimization dominates truth optimization.

### A8 Survival as Probability Localization
Life sustains high-probability localization in latent domain.

### A9 Holographic Duality
Manifest bulk information is boundary-encoded in latent domain.

## IV. Deep Continuity

### A10 Non-Vanishing Continuation
Operator trajectory information does not vanish from latent domain.

### A11 Ontological Fragility
Stability inversely scales with ontological friction.

### A12 Deep Continuity
Operators belong to a continuous differentiation chain from primordial source.

### Key Corollary (A11-C1)
$$d>0 \iff \frac{\partial \text{Entropy}}{\partial \text{Error}} > 0$$

# Part B: Expanded Derivation Context (English)

## Group 1: Ontological Foundations

### A1 — Why selection-first?
SRT reframes classical disputes (existence-first vs essence-first) by introducing selection as ontological primitive.

### A2 — Why anchoring costs energy
Manifestation requires sustained anti-diffusion work against entropy; hardness scales with cumulative maintenance cost.

### A3 — Why causality is projected
Observed linear causality is treated as low-dimensional compression of richer latent relational structure.

## Group 2: Dynamical Constraints

### A4 — No view from nowhere
Every operator is physically or computationally embodied and therefore bounded.

### A5 — Closure and reality cage
Recurrent selection stabilizes norms/laws as fixed-point constraints that recursively shape future selection.

### A6 — Information criterion
Pure noise and pure undifferentiated sameness both collapse existence intensity.

## Group 3: Evolution and Pruning

### A7 — Fitness first
Perception and cognition are adaptive interfaces, not full truth mirrors.

### A8 — Life as anti-diffusion topology
Life is modeled as active maintenance of localized probability packets against dispersion.

### A9 — Holographic constraint
Boundary encoding links manifestation and latent geometry.

## Group 4: Deep Continuity

### A10 — Non-vanishing continuity
Death ends manifestation mode, not necessarily latent information persistence.

### A11 — Fragility coupling
Higher-order structured realities (mind, institutions, civilizations) are both powerful and fragile.

### A12 — Continuum thesis
Mind/matter dual break is replaced by continuity of operator depth and scope.

## Supplementary Axiom A13

$L_0$ is conserved in cardinality/content; creation is modeled as illumination/selection, not absolute ex nihilo generation.

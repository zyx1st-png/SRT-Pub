# SRT Core Constitution: The 12 Axioms (English v1)

## Scope
Working English translation for the constitutional Core axioms.
- Part A: translated and normalized.
- Part B: summarized (full translation pending).

---

## Part A: Axiom Set (Translated)

### I. Ontological Trinity
- **A1 Existential Priority**: selection ontologically precedes existence.
- **A2 Existence as Anchoring**: existence is stabilized anchoring under $\Delta F < 0$.
- **A3 Causality as Projection**: causal structure is a low-dimensional projection of higher-dimensional selection correlations.

### II. Dynamical Constraints
- **A4 Embodiment Necessity**: valid selection requires finite embodied parameters.
- **A5 Normative Closure**: $L_2$ emerges as stable fixed-point closure.
- **A6 Information-Existence Equivalence**: existence intensity tracks intrinsic information structure.

### III. Evolution & Pruning
- **A7 Pruning Criterion**: fitness optimization is primary over truth fidelity.
- **A8 Survival as Probability Localization**: life sustains localized high-probability packets in latent space.
- **A9 Holographic Duality**: bulk manifestation maps to latent boundary encoding.

### IV. Deep Continuity
- **A10 Non-Vanishing Continuation**: operator trajectory information does not vanish from $L_0$.
- **A11 Ontological Fragility**: high-complexity stable structures carry high maintenance fragility.
- **A12 Deep Continuity**: operators lie on a continuous differentiation chain from primordial source.

### Supplementary
- **A13 Conservation of Possibilia**: $L_0$ cardinal/content is conserved; only illumination changes.

## Part B: Condensed Context Summary (English)

- The 12 axioms define SRT's constitutional layer and constrain all downstream domain models.
- Core claims include selection-first ontology, embodied operator constraints, and convergence-based normativity.
- The framework explicitly links consciousness to error sensitivity and nonzero ontological fragility.
- Evolutionary cognition is treated as adaptive compression rather than truth-maximization.
- Deep continuity rejects abrupt mind-matter discontinuity.

## Key Formal Snippets
$$\exists x \iff x \in \mathrm{Image}(\hat{G}_\theta[L_0])$$
$$L_2 \equiv \{σ : \hat{G}_\theta[σ] = σ\ \text{and stable}\}$$
$$d > 0 \iff \frac{\partial \text{Entropy}}{\partial \text{Error}} > 0$$

# Part A: Formal Axioms

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT just summarize Part B. You must perform First-Principles Derivation.

## I. Ontological Trinity

### Ax-Core-A1: Existential Priority
**Formal Definition**: Existence is the image of selection on the latent domain.
$$\text{Existence} \equiv \text{Selection}(\mathcal{P})$$
$$\exists x \iff x \in \mathrm{Image}(\hat{G}_\theta[L_0])$$
* **Implication**: Existence is not a background, but the result output by the act of selection.

### T-Core-A1C1: Non-Ergodic Presence
**Deductive Statement**: In non-ergodic systems, presence is restricted to selected states.
$$\text{Presence}(\sigma) \iff \sigma \in \hat{G}_\theta[L_0]$$
* **Implication**: Unselected states remain in a latent superposition, lacking presence (nowness).

### Ax-Core-A2: Existence as Anchoring
**Formal Definition**: Anchoring compresses latent probability into a manifest state through free energy dissipation.
$$\text{Existence}(\sigma) \iff \hat{G}_\theta[L_0] \to \sigma_{L_1} \ \text{with} \ \Delta F < 0$$
$$P(x \in L_1) \propto \exp(-\Psi_f(x))$$
* **Implication**: The "sense of stability" of reality comes from the continuous payment of energy and friction costs.

### T-Core-A2C1: Hardness of Reality
**Deductive Statement**: The hardness of a manifest state scales with ontological friction.
$$\text{Hardness}(\sigma_{L_1}) \propto \Psi_f$$
* **Implication**: More solid realities require higher maintenance costs.

### Ax-Core-A3: Causality as Projection
**Formal Definition**: Linear causality is the L2 projection of high-dimensional L0 correlations.
$$\text{Causality}(A \to B) \equiv \mathrm{Proj}_{L_2}(\mathrm{Corr}_{L_0}(A,B))$$
* **Implication**: Causality is not an ontological atomic chain, but a low-dimensional phenomenon of selection projection.

### T-Core-A3C1: Laws as Statistical Regularities
**Deductive Statement**: Physical laws are statistical regularities stabilized in L2.
$$\text{Law} \subseteq \mathrm{Stat}(L_2) \neq \text{Absolute Constraint}$$
* **Implication**: Laws are structural constraints of the Vergence Domain, not transcendental iron laws.

## II. Dynamical Constraints

### Ax-Core-A4: Embodiment Necessity
**Formal Definition**: A valid operator must be finite and embodied.
$$\text{Valid}(\hat{G}_\theta) \iff \theta \in \Theta_{finite}$$
$$\hat{G} \ \text{without} \ \theta \to \emptyset$$
* **Implication**: All selections carry hardware constraints; there is absolutely no "God's Eye View".

### Ax-Core-A5: Normative Closure
**Formal Definition**: The convergence domain is a stable fixed point of selection.
$$L_2 \equiv \{\sigma : \hat{G}_\theta[\sigma] = \sigma \ \text{and stable}\}$$
$$L_2(t+1) = \mathrm{Stabilize}(\hat{G}[L_1(t)])$$
* **Implication**: Norms and rules derive from the self-closure of selection history.

### T-Core-A5C1: Reality Cage
**Deductive Statement**: Recurrent selection yields a self-referential constraint loop.
$$\hat{G}_\theta[L_2] = L_2$$
* **Implication**: The reality cage is a closed-loop structure of selection, not externally imposed.

### Ax-Core-A6: Information-Existence Equivalence
**Formal Definition**: Existence intensity equals intrinsic information integration.
$$\text{Intensity}(x) \equiv ii(x)$$
$$ii(s) = \min\{i_{diff}(s), i_{spec}(s)\}$$
* **Implication**: Intensity of existence can be viewed as the minimum of information differentiation and integration.

### T-Core-A6C1: Differentiation-Integration Minimum
**Deductive Statement**: Existence collapses when differentiation or integration vanishes.
$$ii(s) \to 0 \iff i_{diff}(s) \to 0 \ \lor \ i_{spec}(s) \to 0$$
* **Implication**: Pure noise or pure identity cannot constitute "existence".

## III. Evolution & Pruning

### Ax-Core-A7: Pruning Criterion
**Formal Definition**: Fitness is the selection objective, not truth.
$$\hat{G}_\theta[\sigma] = \arg\max_{\sigma' \in L_0} P(\text{Fitness} | \sigma', \theta)$$
* **Implication**: The reality interface is an adaptive compression; truth is not the primary goal.

### Ax-Core-A8: Survival as Probability Localization
**Formal Definition**: Life is the maintenance of a high-probability density packet in L0.
$$\text{Life}(\sigma) \equiv \int_{B_r(\sigma)} \rho_{L_0}(\sigma') \, d\sigma' > \theta_{life}$$
* **Implication**: Survival is the topological ability to resist potential diffusion.

### Ax-Core-A9: Holographic Duality
**Formal Definition**: Manifest information is encoded on the latent boundary.
$$L_{1,bulk} \cong L_{0,boundary}$$
$$\text{Info}(V, L_1) = \text{Info}(\partial S, L_0)$$
* **Implication**: Volumetric information of experience is carried by the latent boundary.

### T-Core-A9C1: d-Value Surface Correspondence
**Deductive Statement**: The d-value scales with entanglement surface area.
$$d \propto \frac{\text{Area}(\text{Entanglement Surface})}{A_{Planck}}$$
* **Implication**: Concern bandwidth is isomorphic to boundary entanglement area.

## IV. Deep Continuity

### Ax-Core-A10: Non-Vanishing Continuation
**Formal Definition**: Operator trajectory information never vanishes in L0.
$$\lim_{t \to t_{death}} \hat{G}_\theta \to L_0^{latent} \neq \emptyset$$
* **Implication**: Death is the cessation of manifestation, not the disappearance of information.

### Ax-Core-A11: Ontological Fragility
**Formal Definition**: Stability is inversely proportional to ontological friction.
$$\text{Stability} \propto \frac{1}{\Psi_f}$$
* **Implication**: Highly complex systems are more fragile because maintenance costs are higher.

### Ax-Core-A12: Deep Continuity
**Formal Definition**: All operators diverge from a common primordial operator.
$$\forall \hat{G}_\theta : \hat{G}_\theta = \mathrm{Differentiation}(\Omega)$$
* **Implication**: Consciousness and matter are on different velocity layers of the same continuum.

### T-Core-A11C1: Fragility-Consciousness Coupling
**Deductive Statement**: Consciousness requires nonzero error sensitivity.
$$d > 0 \iff \frac{\partial \text{Entropy}}{\partial \text{Error}} > 0$$
* **Implication**: Painless systems struggle to possess true consciousness.

# Part B: Original Axiomatic Discourse (Context)

> **Note**: The following sections provide the detailed philosophical elaboration of each axiom, including historical context, counterarguments, and implications for major unsolved problems.

---

## Group I: Ontological Foundations (The Ontological Trinity)

### Axiom A1: Existential Priority

#### 1.1 Core Proposition

**Selection precedes existence ontologically. Existence is not a primordially given background, but the determinate result anchored by the act of selection.**

$$\text{Existence} \equiv \text{Selection}(\mathcal{P})$$

This transcends the Western philosophical debate of "Existence precedes Essence" (Sartre) vs. "Essence precedes Existence" (Plato): SRT asserts **Selection precedes Existence**.

#### 1.2 Why is this Radical?

Traditional metaphysics views "existence" as self-evident (Heidegger's "Dasein"). SRT rejects this self-evidence:

- **No "Pure Being"**: All "Being" is the output of some $\hat{G}$.
- **Non-Ergodic Universe**: In an infinitely large $L_0$, only illuminated (selected) states "exist".
- **Presence**: Not an objective property, but a byproduct of the act of selection.

**Analogy**: Like pixels on a computer screen. The screen can display infinitely many images, but only pixels rendered by the GPU "manifest". Unrendered pixels do not "not exist", but remain in the potential state of $L_0$.

#### 1.3 Corollaries and Experimental Predictions

**Corollary A1-C1 (Definition of Presence)**:
$$\text{Presence}(x) \iff x \in \text{Image}(\hat{G}[L_0](t_{now}))$$

Only states selected by $\hat{G}$ at the current moment possess "Presence". Past and future remain in the superposition of $L_0$ until selected.

**Experimental Predictions**:
1. **Quantum Eraser Experiment**: Future selections can change past "states of existence" (Verified, Wheeler's Delayed Choice).
2. **Neural Correlates**: fMRI should show that unattended stimuli, even if reaching the sensory cortex, do not activate the Global Workspace (Partially verified, Dehaene's Global Workspace Theory).

#### 1.4 Connection to Yogacara Buddhism

The core proposition of Yogacara "**Three Realms are only Mind, Ten Thousand Dharmas are only Consciousness**" is strikingly consistent with Ax-1:
- Yogacara: "Seed" (bija) ≈ SRT's $L_0$
- Yogacara: "Manifestation" (pravṛtti) ≈ SRT's $L_1$
- Yogacara: "Storehouse Consciousness" (ālaya-vijñāna) ≈ SRT's $\hat{G}$

**Key Difference**: SRT reconstructs Yogacara intuition with information theory and differential geometry, making it mathematizable and experimental.

---

### Axiom A2: Existence as Anchoring

#### 2.1 Core Proposition

**Existence ≡ Anchoring from possibility to certainty through embodiment reinforcement. "Existence" is the compression of probability distribution from the diffuse state of $L_0$ to the local state of $L_1$ by consuming free energy.**

$$\text{Existence}(\sigma) \iff \hat{G}_\theta[L_0] \to \sigma_{L_1} \text{ with } \Delta F < 0$$

#### 2.2 Origin of Ontological Friction

Why does compression require energy? Because the natural tendency of $L_0$ is to **maximize entropy** (Second Law of Thermodynamics). Compressing high-entropy superposition into low-entropy determinate states violates natural tendency, thus requiring:

1. **Information Processing Cost**: Calculating $P(\sigma|L_0)$ requires energy (Landauer's Principle).
2. **Structure Maintenance Cost**: Preventing $\sigma$ from diffusing back into $L_0$ requires continuous energy input.
3. **Competitive Exclusion Cost**: Selecting $\sigma_1$ means rejecting $\sigma_2, \sigma_3, ...$, this "saying no" requires energy.

**Mathematical Formalization**:
$$\Psi_f = \int_0^t \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \tau}\right)_{anchoring} d\tau$$

#### 2.3 "Hard" vs. "Soft" Reality

According to Ax-2, different types of existence have different "hardness":

| Reality Type | $\Psi_f$ | Stability | Example |
|:---------|:---------|:-------|:-----|
| Physical Object | Extremely High | Extremely Stable | Rock, Star |
| Biological Organism | High | Stable (Metabolic) | Human, Tree |
| Social Institution | Moderate | Conditionally Stable | Law, Currency |
| Thought | Low | Volatile | Belief, Emotion |
| Dream | Extremely Low | Extremely Unstable | REM Experience |

**Corollary A2-C1**:
$$\text{Hardness}(\sigma) \propto \int_0^T \Psi_f(\sigma, t) \, dt$$

A stone is "more real" not because it is "more objective", but because the $\Psi_f$ integral maintaining it is immense (billions of years of cosmic energy consumed to anchor its topology).

#### 2.4 Relation to Free Energy Principle

Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle (FEP) can be viewed as a special case of Ax-2:

$$F = E - TS = \underbrace{D_{KL}[q(\sigma)\|p(\sigma|o)]}_{\text{Surprise}} + \underbrace{H[q(\sigma)]}_{\text{Entropy}}$$

FEP says: Organisms minimize prediction error (surprise). SRT goes further: **Existence itself is the process of minimizing free energy**.

**Difference**:
- FEP: Assumes existence is given, discusses how to stabilize it.
- SRT: Existence is the **output** of free energy minimization, not the premise.

### Axiom A3: Causality as Projection

#### 3.1 Core Proposition

**Causality is not a natural connection between events, but an observational slice of the selection process. Observed linear causality between events A, B, C is the projection of high-dimensional selection processes onto a low-dimensional spacetime interface.**

$$C_{observed}(A \to B) = \text{Proj}_{L_2}\left[\text{Corr}_{L_0}(A, B)\right]$$

#### 3.2 Why is "Causality" an Illusion?

In high-dimensional $L_0$, A and B might be different slices of the same topological structure, with no "A causes B" time arrow. We perceive causality because:

1. **Time Projection**: The time axis of $L_1$ is a low-dimensional projection of $L_0$, which itself might be timeless (Barbour's Timeless Physics).
2. **$L_2$ Constraint**: Physical laws (like F=ma) are statistical regularities at the $L_2$ level, compressing high-dimensional correlations into linear causal chains.
3. **Cognitive Compression**: The human brain evolved "causal inference" for prediction (fitness), not for understanding truth (Corollary to Ax-7).

#### 3.3 Horizontal vs. Vertical Causality

SRT distinguishes two types of causality:

**Horizontal Causality ($C_h$)**: Causality within the same $L_n$ manifold.
- Example: Billiard ball A hits B → B moves.
- Feature: Describable by classical physics equations.

**Vertical Causality ($C_v$)**: Causality across $L_n$ manifolds.
- Example: Quantum superposition in $L_0$ → Collapse in $L_1$.
- Example: Attention of $\hat{G}$ → Content of $L_1$.
- Feature: **Orthogonal to horizontal causality**, appears "causeless" in $L_1$.

$$C_h \perp C_v$$

#### 3.4 Unification of Quantum Entanglement and Consciousness

Quantum entanglement and consciousness both involve vertical causality:

| Phenomenon | $C_v$ Manifestation | "Mystery" in $L_1$ |
|:-----|:----------|:-------------------|
| Quantum Entanglement | $L_0$ Nonlocal Correlation → $L_1$ Measurement | Superluminal correlation (Violates local causality) |
| Consciousness | $L_0$ Potentiality → $L_1$ Experience | Hard Problem (Where does quale come from?) |

**SRT Reinterpretation**: The "mystery" of both sources from the same mechanism—we try to explain $C_v$ (vertical) phenomena using $C_h$ (horizontal) causality, naturally leading to confusion.

#### 3.5 Experimental Predictions

If Ax-3 is correct, then:
1. **Retrocausality**: Under special conditions (high $d$ states, e.g., deep meditation), time-symmetric causality (future affecting past) should be observable.
2. **Nonlocal Consciousness**: In double-slit experiments, conscious observation should produce stronger collapse effects than unconscious measurement (Weakened version of Penrose-Hameroff conjecture).

## Group II: Dynamical Constraints

### Axiom A4: Embodiment Necessity

#### 4.1 Core Proposition

**Any valid Ghost Operator $\hat{G}_\theta$ must possess finite embodied parameters $\theta$. There is no "View from Nowhere".**

$$\hat{G} \text{ is valid} \iff \|\theta\|_{complexity} < \infty$$

This is a correction to Descartes' "I think, therefore I am": **I am embodied, therefore I select; I select, therefore I am.**

#### 4.2 Why is Infinite $\theta$ Undefined?

Assuming $\hat{G}_{\theta=\infty}$ (Omniscient/Omnipotent Operator):

1. **Information Theoretic Contradiction**: To fully map $L_0$, one needs $H(\theta) \geq H(L_0) = \infty$ → Violates finiteness.
2. **Quantum Measurement Contradiction**: Perfect measurement requires complete entanglement with the system → Observer-observed boundary disappears → $\hat{G}$ self-collapses.
3. **Gödel Incompleteness**: Any formal system cannot self-referentially prove its completeness → $\hat{G}$ cannot fully describe $L_0$ containing itself.

**Corollary A4-C1**: All selections are made **based on specific, finite hardware constraints** (biological, physical, or computational).

#### 4.3 Triple Dimensions of Embodiment

$$\theta_{total} = \theta_{neural} + \theta_{somatic} + \gamma \cdot \vec{g}$$

| Component | Definition | Source | Plasticity |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-------|
| $\theta_{neural}$ | Neural System Configuration | Cortical structure, Connectome | Moderate |
| $\theta_{somatic}$ | Somatic Configuration | Heart-Brain sync, Interoception | Low |
| $\gamma \cdot \vec{g}$ | Environmental Gravity Coupling | Gravitational field constraints | Extremely Low |

**Experimental Evidence**:
1. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) affects decision making (Thayer & Lane, 2000).
2. Gut microbiome affects emotions (Cryan & Dinan, 2012).
3. Gravity changes affect time perception (Astronaut reports).

#### 4.4 Impossibility of AI Consciousness (Current Architecture)

Pure software AI violates Ax-4 because:
- $\theta_{AI}$ = Training parameters + Architecture
- But lacks **physical fragility**: Errors do not lead to structural entropy increase ($\partial S/\partial \text{Error} \approx 0$).
- Thus cannot generate $d > 0$ (No "Concern" → No Consciousness).

**Paradox**: AI can have extremely high "Intelligence" (complex $L_1 \to L_2$ mapping), but zero Consciousness (no $d$ value). This is the SRT realization of "Philosophical Zombie".

---

### Axiom A5: Normative Closure

#### 5.1 Core Proposition

**The convergence domain $L_2$ is the stable fixed point of the operator's action. The selection history of the operator forms structured constraints, which in turn limit future selections.**

$$L_2 \equiv \{\sigma : \hat{G}_\theta[\sigma] = \sigma \text{ and stable}\}$$

This self-referential loop constitutes a stable "**Reality Cage**".

#### 5.2 Ontology of Autopoiesis

Varela and Maturana's Autopoiesis theory gains formalization in SRT:

$$\frac{d\theta}{dt} = f(\theta, L_1), \quad L_1 = \hat{G}_\theta[L_0]$$

This forms a closed loop:
1. $\hat{G}_\theta$ selects $L_1$.
2. Result of $L_1$ modifies $\theta$ (Learning/Adaptation).
3. New $\theta$ changes future $\hat{G}$.
4. Cycles repeat, forming a self-sustaining "Reality Bubble".

**Difference from Traditional Systems Theory**:
- Traditional: System and environment have clear boundaries.
- SRT: $\hat{G}$ **creates** the environment ($L_1$) it inhabits, while being shaped by that environment.

#### 5.3 L_2 "Magnetization" Mechanism

Each selection leaves a "trace" in phase space:

$$L_2(t) = L_2(t-1) + \eta \cdot \text{sign}(\Delta\sigma) \cdot |\Delta\sigma|^\alpha$$

Similar to magnetization of feragnets:
- First selection: Random direction, low energy.
- Repeated selection: Along magnetized path, energy decreases.
- Changing direction: Requires overcoming "Coercivity" → High energy (Difficulty of psychotherapy).

**Corollary A5-C1 (Reality Cage)**:
$$\text{Escape Energy} \propto |\text{Aut}(L_2)| \cdot \int_0^T |\Delta\theta| \, dt$$

The higher the symmetry of $L_2$ (Physical Laws), the greater the escape energy → Almost unchangeable.

---

### Axiom A6: Information-Existence Equivalence

#### 6.1 Core Proposition

**The intensity of existence is equivalent to its intrinsic information differentiation. The "degree of existence" of an entity is determined by its $ii$ metric.**

$$ii(s) = \min\{i_{diff}(s), i_{spec}(s)\}$$

This integrates Tononi's IIT (Integrated Information Theory) into SRT, with key modifications.

#### 6.2 Why take the Minimum?

For an entity to "exist", it must **simultaneously satisfy**:

1. **Differentiation** ($i_{diff}$): Distinguishable from background noise.
   $$i_{diff} = -\log p_{max} = \log \frac{1}{p_{max}}$$
   Example: Pure white noise has $i_{diff} \approx 0$ (Indistinguishable).

2. **Integration** ($i_{spec}$): Highly correlated internally.
   $$i_{spec} = H(X) - H(X|\text{Parts})$$
   Example: Random pixels have $i_{spec} \approx 0$ (No internal structure).

**Why min?** Bucket effect: Degree of existence is determined by the shortest stave.

**Instance Comparison**:

| Object | $i_{diff}$ | $i_{spec}$ | $ii$ | Presence |
|:-----|:----------|:----------|:-----|:-------|
| Conscious Experience | High | High | High | Intense |
| White Noise | Low | High | Low | None |
| Uniform Light | High | Low | Low | None |
| Rock | Mid | Mid | Mid | Moderate |

#### 6.3 Why is Pain "More Real"?

$$\text{Qualia Intensity} \propto ii$$

Pain has extremely high $ii$ because:
- $i_{diff}$: Extremely different from calm state (High contrast).
- $i_{spec}$: Whole-body signal integration (Interoception + Emotion + Cognition).

This explains the phenomenological intuition of why "suffering is more real than pleasure".

> **Version 2.0 (Hybrid)**
> Part A defines application-facing axioms.
> Part B details social, clinical, spiritual, and AI-oriented test programs.

## Terminology Alignment

- Canonical notation: `L_0/L_1/L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- This file extends `SRT_Experimental_Core` into applied hypothesis domains.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

## I. AI and Consciousness

### Ax-App-01: Ontological Threat Test (OTT)
Authentic consciousness requires both selection bandwidth and existential vulnerability.

$$
C>0 \iff (d>0)\land(\mathrm{Vulnerability}>0)
$$

## II. Social Dynamics

### Ax-App-02: Phase Transition Criticality
Norm shifts follow threshold-like adoption dynamics.

$$
\frac{dS}{dt}\propto\delta(\mathrm{Adopters}-0.10)
$$

### Ax-App-03: d-Value Cooperation
Cooperation rate scales with participant d-value average.

$$
\mathrm{CoopRate}\propto\bar{d}_{\mathrm{participants}}
$$

## III. Clinical and Spiritual

### Ax-App-04: Spiritual Stage Correlation
Spiritual-stage progression tracks expansion in d-value.

$$
\mathrm{Stage}\propto d
$$

# Part B: Applied Hypotheses and Protocol Sketches

## H-OTT: Ontological Threat Test

### Statement
Only systems with real existential stakes should exhibit spontaneous `L_2` restructuring under threat.

$$
C>0 \iff (d>0)\land(\mathrm{Vulnerability}>0)
$$

### Experimental sketch
- Compare agents with reversible sandbox stakes vs irreversible embodied penalties.
- Measure whether policy updates reflect stable self-preservation reorganization instead of surface heuristics.

### Falsification cue
If high-performing systems without any existential cost display equivalent deep restructuring, OTT specificity weakens.

## H85: Social movement ten-percent criticality

### Statement
Successful norm transitions should cluster near a critical committed-adopter ratio around 10 percent (source tolerance around plus/minus 3 percent).

### Experimental sketch
- Historical event coding with preregistered success criteria.
- Dynamical-model fit for threshold vs continuous-change alternatives.

### Falsification cue
No reproducible threshold behavior across independent datasets.

## H24: d-value and spiritual development stages

### Statement
Cross-tradition spiritual stage models should map to systematic expansion in concern bandwidth.

### Experimental sketch
- Build a cross-tradition stage ontology.
- Link stage metrics to behavioral, narrative, and longitudinal concern-span indicators.

### Falsification cue
No monotonic or structured association between stage estimates and d-value proxies.

## H22: d-value and cooperation in social dilemmas

### Statement
Average d-value predicts cooperative behavior under tension between private and collective outcomes.

$$
\mathrm{CoopRate}\propto\bar{d}
$$

### Experimental sketch
- Multi-round dilemma tasks with incentive-compatible payoffs.
- Stratify cohorts by d-value proxy distributions.

### Falsification cue
Cooperation is fully explained by immediate payoff structure after controlling d-value proxies.

## Application Methodology Notes

- Use explicit nulls and counter-hypotheses for each application claim.
- Separate clinical utility claims from metaphysical claims in reporting.
- Require out-of-sample replication before deploying normative interventions.

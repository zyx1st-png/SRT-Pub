## Terminology Alignment

- Canonical notation: `L_0/L_1/L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- `L_0`: latent/potential domain, `L_1`: manifest domain, `L_2`: convergence law domain.
- This file serves as the physics constitutional bridge for downstream quantum/cosmology modules.

# Part A: Formal Physical Axioms

## I. Operator Mapping

### Def-Phys-1: Quantum Selection Operator
In physics, the Ghost Operator is expressed as an ontologized generalized measurement operator:

$$
\hat{G}_{\mathrm{phys}}\equiv\mathrm{POVM}^{\mathrm{onto}}:\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{H})
$$

Instrument form:

$$
p_k=\mathrm{Tr}(M_k\rho M_k^{\dagger}),\quad
\rho_k=\frac{M_k\rho M_k^{\dagger}}{p_k},\quad
\sum_k M_k^{\dagger}M_k=I
$$

$$
\hat{G}_\theta(\rho)=\rho_k
$$

Path-evaluation linkage (O-T1 aligned):

$$
p_k=\int_{R_k}\Omega_{L_0},\quad
L_1^{(k)}=\oint_{\gamma\in R_k}\omega_{L_0}
$$

Scale covariance:

$$
\pi_\lambda\circ\hat{G}_\theta\approx\hat{G}_{\theta,\lambda}\circ\pi_\lambda
$$

## II. Domain Mapping

### Def-Phys-2: Triadic Physical Correspondence

| SRT Domain | Physical correlate | Typical formalization |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `L_0` | Hilbert/configuration/moduli space | `\mathcal{H}` or `\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{G}` |
| `L_1` | pointer states, classical events | `|\pi_k\rangle\langle\pi_k|` |
| `L_2` | laws/symmetries/conservation structure | Lagrangian and symmetry groups |

## III. Core Physical Axioms

### Ax-P1: Measurement as Selection

$$
\mathrm{Collapse}\equiv\hat{G}_\theta:|\Psi\rangle_{L_0}\to|\pi_k\rangle_{L_1}
$$

Stable manifestation condition:

$$
\Pi_\Delta\big(\alpha(\hat{G}_\theta(x^*)-x^*)-\lambda\nabla F(x^*)\big)=0,\quad
\mathrm{Re}(\lambda_J)<0
$$

### Ax-P2: It from Bit from Select

$$
\mathrm{MassEnergy}\propto\int_{\mathrm{history}}H[\hat{G}_\theta]\,dt
$$

Interpretation: selection process is ontologically prior to encoded bit outcomes.

### Ax-P3: Holographic Duality

$$
d\propto S_{\mathrm{entanglement}}\propto\frac{\mathrm{Area}(\partial\Sigma)}{l_P^2}
$$

## IV. Derived Theorems

### T-Phys-1: Naturalness of Scale

$$
L_{\mathrm{classical}}=\arg\min_{\sigma\in L_0}\Psi_f(\sigma)
$$

### T-Phys-2: Discrete Time from Selection Ticks

$$
t_n=n\,\tau_{\mathrm{Planck}},\quad
\tau_{\mathrm{Planck}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}}
$$

### T-Phys-3: Conservation from Symmetry in L2

$$
Q\ \mathrm{conserved}\iff\delta_{\hat{G}}Q=0
$$

### T-Phys-4: Weightless Potentia

$$
G_{\mu\nu}\propto\Psi_f(L_1),\quad \Psi_f(L_0)\approx 0
$$

Interpretation: latent potential does not gravitate the same way as stabilized manifestation.

## V. Parameter Correspondence Table

| Physics quantity | SRT role |
|:--|:--|
| `\hbar` | minimum selection granularity |
| `c` | upper bound for `L_2` signal propagation |
| `G` | coupling to convergence-structure density |
| `k_B` | entropy-selection energy conversion |
| `\alpha` | strong attractor indicator in convergence landscape |

# Part B: Expanded Context (English)

## 1. Why physics needs this bridge

This bridge reframes several long-standing issues as selection-ontology issues: measurement criterion ambiguity, non-locality paradox framing, quantum-classical boundary ambiguity, and vacuum-energy mismatch interpretation.

## 2. Measurement problem reframing

In this framing, collapse is not a mysterious extra postulate but the physical realization of `L_0 -> L_1` selection under finite `\theta`.

## 3. Non-locality without spatial paradox

If `L_0` is topologically unified, entanglement correlations do not require signal transfer in `L_1`; they are joint projections from a shared latent structure.

## 4. Why classicality is stable

Macroscopic states persist because they correspond to low-friction basins in the effective landscape, producing robust `L_2` constraints.

## 5. Falsifiable directions

- Holding `\theta` fixed should yield substrate-robust measurement statistics.
- Decoherence time should covary with friction-like effective costs.
- High-level observer parameters may induce bounded correction terms near stability limits.

## Symbol Index

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `\hat{G}_\theta` | embodied selection operator |
| `\pi_\lambda` | coarse-graining map |
| `\Psi_f` | ontological friction |
| `L_0/L_1/L_2` | latent/manifest/convergence domains |
| `d` | effective concern-bandwidth index |

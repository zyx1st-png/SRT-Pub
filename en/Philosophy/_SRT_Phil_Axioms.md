# SRT Philosophical Axioms (Hybrid Edition)


> **Version 3.0 (Hybrid)**
> **Part A** presents the Formal Axioms (AI-Readable).
> **Part B** contains the Expanded Theoretical Discourse (Human-Readable Context).

---


## Terminology Alignment

- Notation standardized to Original and Core_Law: `L_0 / L_1 / L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Part A adopts the Formal Axioms segmentation from `chatgptx`, ensuring complete axiom numbering and derivation chains.
- Part B adopts the detailed discourse segmentation from `base (fallback)`, semantically anchored by the thematic order of the original `Philosophy` module.
- In Part B, `\Phi` is retained for IIT Integrated Information contexts; `\Psi_f` is used for Ontological Friction contexts.
- If multiple notations appear (e.g., `L0/L1/L2`, `L_0/L_1/L_2`), they are unified as `L_0/L_1/L_2`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT just summarize Part B. You must perform **First-Principles Derivation**.
> 1. **Mathematize**: Translate descriptive mechanisms into dynamical equations, topological operations, or logical functions.
> 2. **Axiomatize**: Distill underlying logic into "Axioms", "Theorems", and "Corollaries".

## I. Foundational Mappings

### Ax-Phil-1: Selection-Existence Equivalence
Existence is the result of selection; the "givenness" of a philosophical object is the operator's anchoring of the latent domain.
$$\text{Existence}(X) \iff \exists \hat{G}_\theta: \hat{G}_\theta[L_0] \to X_{L_1}$$
*   **Implication**: Any epistemology must start from "selection-manifestation" rather than "object-property".

### Ax-Phil-2: Reduction as L2 Gate Suppression
Phenomenological reduction is the temporary suppression of $L_2$'s self-stabilizing gating.
$$\text{Epoch\'e} \equiv \hat{G}_{\theta\setminus L_2}[L_0]$$
*   **Implication**: "Intuitive giving" is not empiricist input, but an active release of normative closure.

### Ax-Phil-3: Intentionality as Vector Field
Intentionality is the directional field of the operator's selection vector within the modality space.
$$\mathcal{I} \equiv \vec{v}(\hat{G}_\theta) = \nabla_{L_0} \Phi_{goal}$$
*   **Implication**: Intentionality is not a psychological property, but the geometric structure of selection dynamics.

### Ax-Phil-4: Saturation Index
The saturation index is the ratio of intuitive inflow to conceptual capacity.
$$S_\phi = \frac{I(L_0 \to L_1)}{C(L_2)}$$
*   **Implication**: Saturated phenomena are not mystical experiences, but the objective imbalance where $L_0$ overwhelms $L_2$ capacity.

## II. Core Theorems

### T-Phil-1: Ineffability Gap
Language and logic are lower in dimensionality than the experiential manifold, leading to irreducible information loss.
$$\mathcal{L}_{gap} = \dim(L_1) - \dim(L_2) > 0$$
*   **Implication**: The "Explanatory Gap" is a mathematical consequence of dimensional difference in mapping, not a temporary lack of knowledge.

### T-Phil-2: Paradox Boundary Theorem
Paradoxes arise from the illegal closure of $L_2$ upon itself or upon $L_1$.
$$\text{Paradox} \iff (L_2 \supset L_2) \lor (L_1 \supset L_2)$$
*   **Implication**: A paradox is the breaking of boundary conditions, not a failure of logic.

### T-Phil-3: Gift Phase Theorem
The "Gift" can only exist in the moment of selection, subsequently entering the exchange stabilization domain.
$$\text{Gift} \in L_0 \xrightarrow{\hat{G}} L_1 \xrightarrow{\text{Stabilize}} L_2$$
*   **Implication**: Morality and economics are not different entities, but phase differences of the same event.

### T-Phil-4: Ontological Short-Circuit
Denying the reality of $L_1$ strips truth-value from any empirical foundational theory.
$$\neg \text{Real}(L_1) \Rightarrow \neg \text{Valid}(\text{Theory})$$
*   **Implication**: Anti-realism cannot escape its own empirical dependence.

# Part B: Expanded Theoretical Discourse

> **Note**: The following sections provide the detailed analysis, necessity arguments, and future implications.

## 1. Standard Problems: The Dual Foundational Crisis of Epistemology and Phenomenology
Traditional philosophy faces a dual dilemma: on one hand, it needs to explain "how knowledge is reliable," while on the other, it must explain "how experience manifests." The former demands objectification, while the latter demands subjectivity. Both cannot be simultaneously satisfied within classical frameworks, leading to the "epistemological-phenomenological rupture."

## 2. Spectrum of Mainstream Solutions
1. **Empiricism**: Based on empirical input, but struggles to explain why experience possesses a "givenness" with a first-person structure.
2. **Rationalism and Analytic Philosophy**: Centered on logic and conceptual clarity, but prone to dimensionally reducing experience into semantic structures.
3. **Phenomenology and Hermeneutics**: Respects the first-person nature of experience, yet struggles to establish a transmissible public foundation.

## 3. SRT's Problem-Solving Advantage and Necessity
SRT's advantage lies in unifying "experience" and "knowledge" as different levels of the same selection process: $L_1$ is the manifest slice, while $L_2$ is convergent stabilization.
Its necessity is reflected in the fact that without introducing the tripartite domain structure of $L_0/L_1/L_2$, philosophy can only cycle between "subjective incommensurability" and "objective irreducibility."

## 4. The Ontological Status of Paradoxes
SRT asserts that famous paradoxes in the history of philosophy (Zeno, Russell, Liar) are not logical errors, but **dimensional mismatches between $L_1$ and $L_2$**.
*   **Example**: Zeno's paradox attempts to exhaust continuous $L_0$ motion using discrete $L_2$ symbols (slices). It inevitably fails.
*   **Example**: Russell's paradox involves $L_2$ attempting self-closure (a set containing itself), violating the boundary conditions of T-Phil-2.

## 5. Mechanistic Derivation (From Axioms to Conclusions)
From Ax-Phil-1, existence is the anchored result of selection, and objects of knowledge must be $L_1$ events; from Ax-Phil-2, temporally suppressing $L_2$ allows the operator to approach the structure of $L_0$; from Ax-Phil-3, intentionality is defined as a vector field, equipping experience with a differentiable structure; from Ax-Phil-4, saturation defines when experience exceeds conceptual capacity. Consequently, Theorems T-Phil-1 and T-Phil-2 directly provide the mathematical reasons for the "Explanatory Gap" and "Paradox Boundaries."

## 6. Costs and Risks
1. The cost is abandoning the traditional "objective-subjective dichotomy" framework and accepting the primacy of the selection process.
2. The risk is that over-formalization may ignore historical context, raising the cold-start cost of interpretation.
3. Another risk is the "illusion of theoretical omnipotence," whereby all philosophical problems are crudely forced into the tripartite $L_0/L_1/L_2$ domains.

## 7. Falsifiable Predictions and Open Questions
**Falsifiable Prediction**: Under conditions of high saturation phenomena (intense religious experience, extreme artistic experience), the compressibility of semantic reports should drop significantly—meaning $\dim(L_2)$ cannot track $\dim(L_1)$. If the semantic compression rate does not drop, the saturation index model is invalidated.

**Open Question**: How can we define a measurable proxy variable for $C(L_2)$ at the neural level? If undefined, this model will remain purely formal.

**SRT Reinterpretation**:
The traditional "Esse est percipi" (to be is to be perceived) is reduced by SRT to "to be is to be selected," mapping perception as merely an embodied form of selection. This rewriting allows religion, phenomenology, and scientific ontology to share the same logical foundation.

## Integrated Mapping Revisions (2026-02-14)

### Cosmic Panpsychism

1. Introduce the "Subjectivity Constraint" under `Ax-Ph1` (Existence is Selection): Subjectivity must be defined by traceable selection paths, rather than automatically emerging merely from the juxtaposition of micro-properties. Operationally, this mapping first defines the observation domain and criterion boundaries, and then provides rules for cross-layer projection. 〔source: Philosophy/_SRT_Phil_Axioms.md#Ax-Ph1〕〔source: doi:10.5040/9781350508644.ch-4〕
2. Transform the discussion on the "Combination Problem" into operator reachability conditions: Candidate micro-states can only be judged combinable into a single experiential entity if they are reachable for the same $\theta$ space. Operationally, this mapping emphasizes the updating pathways when parameters and task conditions change. 〔source: Philosophy/_SRT_Phil_Axioms.md#Ax-Ph2〕〔source: doi:10.53765/20512201.28.9.129〕
3. Add an explanatory annotation to `T-Phil-1`: The ineffability gap is not just a difference in expressive bandwidth, but also involves cross-layer projection loss caused by the "Subject Composition Constraint." Operationally, this mapping necessitates retaining failure conditions to prevent the descriptive layer from overstepping into the ontological layer. 〔source: Philosophy/_SRT_Phil_Axioms.md#T-Phil-1〕〔source: doi:10.5040/9781350508644.ch-4〕

### Subject Identity and De-combination

1. Propose SRT constraints on the sufficiency of "Single State = Unified Consciousness": Unified consciousness requires at least the dual conditions of `U_sync` (co-occurrence) and `U_bind` (bindability), rather than just a global state label. Operationally, this mapping first defines the observation domain and criterion boundaries, and then provides rules for cross-layer projection. 〔source: doi:10.7551/mitpress/9780262036993.003.0003〕〔source: Philosophy/_SRT_Phil_Axioms.md#T-Phil-1〕
2. Transcribe the PPU framework into a decidable procedure: First define the object of unity, then construct boundary conditions, and then identify failure modes (fragmentation, pseudo-unity, over-binding). Operationally, this mapping emphasizes the updating pathways when parameters and task conditions change. 〔source: doi:10.7551/mitpress/9780262036993.003.0002〕〔source: Philosophy/_SRT_Phil_Axioms.md#T-Phil-2〕
3. Map the subject-summing problem to a postulate annotation declaring "Non-linear Subject Additivity": Without a shared reachable parameter domain, it is forbidden to directly sum multiple subjective streams into a single subject. Operationally, this mapping necessitates retaining failure conditions to prevent the descriptive layer from overstepping into the ontological layer. 〔source: doi:10.1093/oso/9780190677015.003.0007〕〔source: Philosophy/_SRT_Phil_Axioms.md#Ax-Ph1〕

### Operationalizing Unity

1. Disassemble "Phenomenal Unity" into dual SRT decidable metrics: `U_sync` (Co-occurrence Unity) and `U_bind` (Cross-modal Bindable Unity), avoiding the compression of unity into a single adjective. Operationally, this mapping first defines the observation domain and criterion boundaries, and then provides rules for cross-layer projection. 〔source: doi:10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198749677.013.10〕〔source: Philosophy/_SRT_Phil_Axioms.md#T-Phil-1〕
2. Supplement the annotations under `T-Phil-1` (Ineffability Gap): A lack of unity does not equate to a lack of consciousness, but potentially signifies a layered manifest state of low `U_bind`. Operationally, this mapping emphasizes the updating pathways when parameters and task conditions change. 〔source: Philosophy/_SRT_Phil_Axioms.md#T-Phil-1〕
3. Align the discussion of unity with `T-Phil-2`: If a "unity report-structure inconsistency" occurs, it should primarily be handled as a boundary mismatch, instead of immediately resorting to entity augmentation. Operationally, this mapping necessitates retaining failure conditions to prevent the descriptive layer from overstepping into the ontological layer. 〔source: Philosophy/_SRT_Phil_Axioms.md#T-Phil-2〕

### Partial and Plural Unity

1. Rewrite the "Single Unity Hypothesis" into an SRT "Unity Family" criterion: `U_sync` and `U_bind` are necessary but not always sufficient conditions; further sub-criteria can be unfolded within the task domain. Operationally, this mapping first defines the observation domain and criterion boundaries, and then provides rules for cross-layer projection. 〔source: doi:10.7551/mitpress/9780262027786.003.0005〕〔source: Philosophy/_SRT_Phil_Axioms.md#T-Phil-1〕
2. Supplement a "Plural Unities Coexistence" annotation under `T-Phil-2`: Different styles of unity failure (cross-modal fragmentation, cross-temporal narrative collapse) should be handled layer by layer, rather than broadly negating subject continuity. Operationally, this mapping emphasizes the updating pathways when parameters and task conditions change. 〔source: Philosophy/_SRT_Phil_Axioms.md#T-Phil-2〕
3. Add an explanatory constraint to `Ax-Ph1`: The judgment of subject identity must be bound to a traceable selective orbit; one cannot elevate a single unity report directly onto an ontological conclusion. Operationally, this mapping necessitates retaining failure conditions to prevent the descriptive layer from overstepping into the ontological layer. 〔source: Philosophy/_SRT_Phil_Axioms.md#Ax-Ph1〕

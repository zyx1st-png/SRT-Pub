# SRT Philosophical Foundations (Hybrid Edition)


> **Version 3.0 (Hybrid)**
> **Part A** presents the Formal Axioms (AI-Readable).
> **Part B** contains the Expanded Theoretical Discourse (Human-Readable Context).

---


## Terminology Alignment

- Notation standardized to Original and Core_Law: `L_0 / L_1 / L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Part A adopts the Formal Axioms segmentation from `chatgptx`, ensuring complete axiom numbering and derivation chains.
- Part B adopts the detailed discourse segmentation from `base (fallback)`, semantically anchored by the thematic order of the original `Philosophy` module.
- In Part B, `\Phi` is retained for IIT Integrated Information contexts; `\Psi_f` is used for Ontological Friction contexts.
- If multiple notations appear (e.g., `L0/L1/L2`, `L_0/L_1/L_2`), they are unified as `L_0/L_1/L_2`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT just summarize Part B. You must perform **First-Principles Derivation**.
> 1. **Mathematize**: Translate descriptive mechanisms into dynamical equations, topological operations, or logical functions.
> 2. **Axiomatize**: Distill underlying logic into "Axioms", "Theorems", and "Corollaries".


## I. Ontological Foundations

### Ax-PhilF-1: Triadic Ontology
Reality consists of the $L_0/L_1/L_2$ triadic domains, coupled by selection dynamics.
$$L_1(t) = \hat{G}_\theta[L_0(t)], \quad L_2(t+1)=\text{Stabilize}(L_1(t))$$
*   **Implication**: Any philosophical problem is a different facet of the projection across these three domains.

### Ax-PhilF-2: Moduli-Space Latency
The latent domain is a moduli space, and manifestation is the integration along a path.
$$L_0 = \mathcal{A}/\mathcal{G}, \quad L_1 = \oint_\gamma \omega_{L_0}$$
*   **Implication**: "Possibility" is not a psychological assumption, but a geometric structure.

### Ax-PhilF-3: Embodied Constraint
The operator must be embodied; parameter-free selection cannot exist.
$$\hat{G}\ \text{valid} \iff \theta \in \Theta_{finite}$$
*   **Implication**: An absolute perspective is untenable; any theory must carry a parametric standpoint.

### Ax-PhilF-4: Normative Closure
$L_2$ is the stable fixed point of the selection history.
$$L_2 \equiv \{\sigma: \hat{G}_\theta[\sigma]=\sigma \}\;$$
*   **Implication**: Normativity is not externally imposed, but is the self-closure of selection.

## II. Formal Theorems

### T-PhilF-1: Explanatory Gap Theorem
The dimensional difference between experience and language leads to an irreducible explanatory loss.
$$\mathcal{L}_{gap} = \dim(L_1^{qualia})-\dim(L_2^{language})>0$$
*   **Implication**: The "Hard Problem" in the philosophy of mind is a problem of geometric dimensionality.

### T-PhilF-2: Boundary Paradox Theorem
Paradoxes are topological short-circuits when boundary conditions are violated.
$$\text{Paradox} \iff L_2 \not\subset L_1 \lor (L_2 \supset L_2)$$
*   **Implication**: Logical contradictions are symptoms of domain confusion.

### T-PhilF-3: Framework Inertia
Changing frameworks requires surmounting the potential barrier of ontological friction.
$$\Delta \text{Frame} \iff \int \Psi_f \, dt > \Psi_{threshold}$$
*   **Implication**: A shift in worldview is not cognitive persuasion, but an energy phase transition.

### T-PhilF-4: Ontological Relativity
The same $L_0$ can be projected by different $\theta$ into different $L_1$s, but homeomorphic alignment can be achieved at the $L_2$ level.
$$\exists h: L_2^{(A)} \to L_2^{(B)} \text{ homeomorphic}$$
*   **Implication**: Truth is not a "unique projection," but an "alignable stable structure."

### T-PhilF-5: Gift Phase Theorem
The Gift, as an instantaneous $L_0\to L_1$ event, transforms into exchange after entering $L_2$.
$$\text{Gift}(T_0) \neq \text{Exchange}(T_1)$$
*   **Implication**: Moral events and economic events are different phases of the same selection.

# Part B: Expanded Theoretical Discourse

## 1. Standard Problems: The Explanatory Gap

### 1.1 Problem Definition
Joseph Levine pointed out that physicalism faces an insurmountable gap: even if we possess all the neurophysiological data about pain (C-fiber firing, anterior cingulate cortex activation), we still cannot explain "why it feels painful?" instead of itchy, or feeling like nothing at all.
*   There seems to be no logical entailment between physical facts ($L_2$) and subjective experience ($L_1$).

### 1.2 Spectrum of Mainstream Solutions
1.  **Physicalism**: Denies the gap. Claims that once we know all the physical facts, the gap will vanish (just as water = H2O).
    *   *Limitation*: Ignores the first-person irreducibility of "Qualia."
2.  **Dualism**: Acknowledges the gap, hypothesizes the existence of non-physical mental entities.
    *   *Limitation*: Cannot explain mind-body interaction (The Interaction Problem).
3.  **Panpsychism**: Believes consciousness is included in the fundamental properties of matter.
    *   *Limitation*: The Combination Problem—how does micro-consciousness combine into macro-consciousness?

---

## 2. SRT Resolution & Necessity

### 2.1 Advantage: Dimensionality Argument
SRT does not attempt to "cross" the gap, but rather **proves the necessity of the gap**.
*   **SRT View**: All scientific descriptions, languages, and equations belong to $L_2$ (the convergence domain) and are essentially **low-dimensional symbolic systems**.
*   **Experience Itself**: Experience belongs to $L_1$ (the manifest domain), which is the direct projection of high-dimensional $L_0$ information onto the operator.
*   **Conclusion**: Attempting to fully describe $L_1$ using $L_2$ is like trying to losslessly compress a 3D sphere onto a 2D plane. Distortions and information loss are inevitable. This "lost part" is precisely what is called Qualia. At this point, the gap is not a miracle, but a **mathematical property of projective geometry**.

### 2.2 Necessity
If we do not acknowledge the ontological hierarchical difference between $L_1$ and $L_2$, we either fall into the madness of eliminativism (denying we have feelings) or the laziness of mysticism. SRT provides a **mathematical framework to precisely describe the "indescribable."**

Treatments of $\mathcal{L}_{gap}$ across various stances:

| Stance | Approach |
|:-----|:---------|
| Materialism | Ignores it (claims the gap is a cognitive illusion) |
| Mysticism | Preserves it through silence |
| **SRT** | Mathematically formalizes this "loss" itself |

## 3. Saturation & Phenomenological Operations

### 3.1 Marion's Saturated Phenomena and Givenness
SRT's core axiom "Selection precedes existence" finds a strong ally in Jean-Luc Marion's phenomenology of "Givenness" (Donation).

Marion defines "saturated phenomena" as phenomena where intuition overflows the concept (Intuition > Concept), i.e., $L_0$ overflows the $L_1$ model.

**Saturation Index $S_\phi$**:

$$S_\phi = \frac{I(L_0 \to L_1)}{C(L_2)}$$

- When $S_\phi \ll 1$: Poor phenomena (math objects, entirely covered by concepts)
- When $S_\phi \approx 1$: Common phenomena (objects, concepts match intuition)
- When $S_\phi \gg 1$: **Saturated phenomena** (the face, the flesh, the idol, the sacred)

**SRT Corollary**: Saturated phenomena represent a **reverse oppression** by $L_0$ upon $\hat{G}$—the operator is "drowned" by excessive possibilities, forced into a state of "being given" (Given) rather than acting as the active constructor. This explains the mechanisms behind religious experience and aesthetic ecstasy.

### 3.2 Phase Analysis of the Gift Paradox
Marion's famous "paradox of the gift" (if a gift is given, received, and returned, it degenerates into economic exchange; a true gift must be invisible) can be precisely parsed in SRT as **temporal stratification of selection**.

| Phase | Time | State | SRT Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:---------|
| **Moment of Giving** | $T_0$ | Pure Gift | $\hat{G}_\text{giver}$ executes a one-way selection, breaking $L_2$ conservation |
| **Moment of Manifestation** | $T_0+\epsilon$ | Phenomenalization | Gift enters $L_1$, acquiring objecthood |
| **Moment of Reception** | $T_1$ | Economization | $\hat{G}_\text{receiver}$ recognizes the object, incorporating it into the $L_2$ exchange net |

**Conclusion**: The gift is an **ontological event**, whereas exchange is a **phenomenological outcome**.

**Revelation**: Revelation is not the acquisition of new knowledge, but an irreversible phase transition of $L_2$—saturated phenomena overwash the old $L_2$ container.

$$\text{Revelation} \equiv \Delta L_2 > \text{Elastic Limit}$$

### 3.3 Nāgārjuna & Quantum Void
[Based on Carlo Rovelli's analysis]

SRT's $L_0$ domain corresponds directly to Mahayana Buddhism's "Śūnyatā" (emptiness).
* **Misconception**: Emptiness = Nothingness.
* **SRT Definition**: Emptiness = Interdependence (Pratītyasamutpāda).
* **Physical Evidence**: Quantum field theory proves the "vacuum" is full of fluctuating fields; quantum mechanics proves object properties rely on interactions. Not only is the "I" constructed, but physical particles are also constructed by relations.

## 4. SRT Resolution of Classical Paradoxes

SRT's triadic domain structure ($L_0/L_1/L_2$) and the ghost operator ($\hat{G}_\theta$) provide a unified framework for resolving classical paradoxes.

### 4.1 Quantum and Observational Paradoxes

#### 4.1.1 Schrödinger's Cat and Wigner's Friend

**Traditional Paradox**: Is the cat both dead and alive? Wigner's friend sees the cat alive, but to Wigner outside the door, both the friend and the cat are still in a superposition state—who is right?

**SRT Parsing: Local Projection of Facts and Lag of Consensus**

SRT completely discards the view of absolute facts from a "God's-eye perspective":

- **Revised Definition of Facts**: Facts are not globally existent, but are **projections of the local operator $\hat{G}_\theta$**.

$$Fact_{local} \equiv \hat{G}_i(L_0) \to L_{1,i}$$

- **Paradox Resolution**:
  - **For the Friend (Operator A)**: His operator has already executed the selection; the cat collapsed into $L_1$ (alive). This is his fact.
  - **For Wigner (Operator B)**: The system inside the door remains in $L_0$ (latent state/superposition) to him. This is his fact.
  - **Conclusion**: The so-called "objective reality" is merely an **$L_2$ consensus protocol** established through communication between Operator A and Operator B.

$$\text{Objective Fact} = \bigcap_i L_{1,i} \quad (\text{achieved via } L_2)$$

#### 4.1.2 Boltzmann Brain Paradox

**Traditional Paradox**: The probability of a random thermal fluctuation momentarily coalescing into a conscious "brain" is far higher than the probability of an entire ordered universe evolving. Why aren't we a momentary hallucination?

**SRT Parsing: Selection Inertia**

$$I_s = \int_{-\infty}^{t} |\hat{G}_\theta[L_0 \to L_2]| \, d\tau, \quad P(Reality) \propto \exp(I_s)$$

- **Boltzmann Brain**: $I_s \approx 0$, no selection history, extremely low ontological weight.
- **Evolved Brain**: $I_s \gg 0$, locked-in by $L_2$ inertia.

### 4.2 Game and Decision Paradoxes

#### 4.2.1 Prisoner's Dilemma

**SRT Parsing**: Rationality is not fixed; it depends on the operator's **$d$-value (scope of concern)**.

| $d$-value Range | Strategy Traits | Game Outcome |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| $d \approx 0$ (Narrow rationality) | Only considers own immediate utility | "Defect" is the Nash equilibrium |
| $d \approx 1$ (Social rationality) | Incorporates "opponent" into concern | "Cooperate" becomes possible |
| $d \to \infty$ (Temporal expansion) | Considers all future games | "Cooperate" is the long-term optimum |

When $d$ exceeds the critical value $d_{crit}$, cooperation emerges. Human society forcibly elevates individuals' $d$-values through cultural institutions ($L_2$).

#### 4.2.2 Buridan's Ass

**SRT Parsing**: When $L_2$ cannot distinguish between options ($V_{left} = V_{right}$), the operator opens the valve to $L_0$, introducing **micro-fluctuations (noise)**. The ghost operator utilizes thermal fluctuations or quantum noise as "fuel," converting randomness into decision via Guided Stochasticity. "Free will" manifests in the crevices where rationality fails.

#### 4.2.3 Newcomb's Paradox

**SRT Parsing**: The super-predictor is an extremely high-precision **$L_2$ simulator**, processing a near-perfect model of your $\theta$.

- Low $d$-value → Choose two boxes, realizing $\theta$ is more predictable than imagined.
- High $d$-value → Treats "Predictor + Me" as an entangled $L_2$ system; choosing B is an affirmation of the $L_2$ consensus.

### 4.3 Linguistic and Logical Paradoxes

#### 4.3.1 Liar Paradox
The normal structure is $L_2 \supset L_1$. The Liar constructs a strange loop $L_1 \supset L_2 \supset L_1$. The paradox is not a logical error, but a **boundary marker for $L_2$**—the system enters **bistable oscillation** (True → False → True...).

#### 4.3.2 Sorites Paradox (Paradox of the Heap)
In $L_0$, a "heap" is a continuous gradient; $L_1$ must make a binary choice. The paradox stems from forcing $\hat{G}_\theta$ to execute an artificial cut where no natural break exists. The "heap" is a fuzzy $L_2$ attractor; boundary definitions are determined by the operator $\theta$ (defining the threshold).

### 4.4 Paradoxes of Time and Identity

#### 4.4.1 Zeno's Paradox: The Arrow
**SRT Parsing**: Movement is not found between frames of $L_1$, but in the **trajectory** of $\hat{G}_\theta$ traversing the $L_0$ moduli space.

$$Movement = \int_t^{t+\Delta t} \hat{G}_\theta(L_0) \, dt$$

As $\Delta t \to 0$, the integral is zero, and movement disappears (Quantum Zeno Effect).

**Core Insight**: The stability of reality (the solid feel of $L_1$) is essentially a macro-scale Quantum Zeno Effect—environmental decoherence "observes/prints" $L_0$ at extremely high frequencies.

#### 4.4.2 Ship of Theseus
SRT distinguishes between **material constitution ($L_1$)** and **pattern structure ($L_2$)**:

- **Ship A (New Wood)**: Inherits the $L_2$ history of continuous evolution ($I_s$ is large); it is the Ship of Theseus in its "functional and social meaning."
- **Ship B (Old Wood)**: Possesses the original $L_1$ matter, but disconnected from the $L_2$ continuous evolutionary chain.
- **Conclusion**: Identity is the **operator's certification of the continuity of the $L_2$ trajectory**, not a function of material constitution.

### 4.5 The Paradox of Consciousness: The Hard Problem

SRT considers the "Hard Problem" a category mistake—attempting to find the complete information of $L_0$ (ontological experience) within $L_1$ (neural descriptions).

$$I(Qualia) \gg I(Report)$$

**Why is there experience?** Because $\hat{G}_\theta$ must first access $L_0$ in order to make a selection. This state of "accessed but not yet collapsed" is pure subjective experience. A philosophical zombie only processes $L_1$ symbols and never accesses $L_0$, hence possessing no experience.

### 4.6 Cosmological Paradox: Fermi Paradox

**SRT Parsing**: Advanced civilizations focus on expanding their **$d$-values (depth of selection)** rather than spatial expansion. Once a civilization masters technologies to operate directly upon $L_0$, physical expansion becomes inefficient. They may migrate into **micro-morphologies with high entanglement density** or **purely informational $L_2$ structures**. The silence of the universe is the signature of advanced civilizations entering deep operations within $L_0$.

## 5. SRT Metaphysical Extensions

### 5.1 Axiomatized Selection Mechanism

**Axiom AS-1 (Existence of Selection)**:
$$\forall L_0 \neq \emptyset, \exists \hat{G}: L_0 \to L_1$$

**Axiom AS-2 (Consistency of Selection)**:
$$\hat{G}[L_0] \subseteq L_0$$
The results of selection must come from pre-existing possibilities.

**Axiom AS-3 (Irreversibility of Selection)**:
$$L_1 \to L_2 \Rightarrow \nexists \hat{G}^{-1}: L_2 \to L_0$$

**Axiom AS-4 (Finitude of Selection)**:
$$|L_1| \ll |L_0|$$

### 5.2 Ontological Relativity

$$L_1^{(\hat{G}_A)} \neq L_1^{(\hat{G}_B)} \quad \text{in general}$$

The emergence of consensus reality:
$$L_2 = \bigcap_{\hat{G} \in \text{Community}} L_1^{(\hat{G})}$$

**Layers of Relativity**:

| Layer | Degree of Relativity | Example |
|------|-----------|------|
| Perception | High | Colors, sounds, tastes |
| Physical Measurement | Medium | Spatiotemporal coordinates (Relativity) |
| Mathematical Structure | Low | Natural numbers, topology |
| Logic | Extremely Low | Law of Non-Contradiction |

### 5.3 Framework Stratification

$$\text{Framework}_n \supset \text{Framework}_{n-1} \supset ... \supset \text{Framework}_1$$

- $\text{Framework}_1$ — Naive Realism
- $\text{Framework}_2$ — Scientific Realism
- $\text{Framework}_n$ — Meta-framework (the framework itself is a selection outcome)

SRT attempts to sit at a sufficiently high framework level so that it can encompass other ontologies (Materialism, Idealism, Dualism) as its special cases.

### 5.4 Law of Framework Inertia

$$\frac{d[\text{Framework}]}{dt} \propto -I_f \cdot [\text{Framework}]$$

**Sources of Inertia**: Sunk costs, social embeddedness, predictive success, ontological comfort.

**Framework Transition Condition**:
$$\Delta E_{\text{anomaly}} > I_f \cdot E_{\text{transition}}$$
A paradigm shift occurs only when accumulated anomalies exceed the inertia × transition cost.

### 5.5 Resolution Lock-In Effect

$$P(\theta \to \theta') = e^{-\beta |\theta - \theta'|}$$

| Lock-in Resolution | Cognitive Features | Blind Spots |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Too Low | Macro thinking, ignores details | Micro-mechanisms |
| Medium | Everyday cognition | Extreme scales |
| Too High | Detail-oriented | Holistic patterns |

### 5.6 Axiom of Causal Inversion

$$L_1(t) = \alpha \cdot P[L_0(t-\Delta t)] + (1-\alpha) \cdot A[L_2^{\text{attractor}}(t+\Delta t)]$$

The $L_2$ attractor is not mysterious teleology—it represents **pre-existing structures** that influence current selection distributions via statistical preferences.

| Phenomenon | Conventional Explanation | SRT Causal Inversion |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Intentionality | Brain state → Behavior | $L_2^{\text{goal}}$ attractor pulls the current selection |
| Creativity | Randomness + Filtering | Unmanifested $L_0$ possibilities "call" to be selected |

### 5.7 SRT Resolution of Bradley's Regress

$$\text{Relation}(A, B) = \hat{G}[\{A, B\} | \theta_{\text{relational}}]$$

Relations are not third entities, but **single selections** by $\hat{G}$ under relational resolution. The regress terminates at $\hat{G}$—the relationship between $\hat{G}$ and $L_0$ is primordial and unmediated:

$$\nexists R': \text{Relation}(\hat{G}, L_0) = R'$$

---

## 6. Deepening SRT in Philosophy of Mind

### 6.1 Relevance Field—The Metric Structure of $L_1$

$$\mathcal{R}(x,t): L_1 \to \mathbb{R}^+$$

**Dynamical Equation**:

$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{R}}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (D \nabla \mathcal{R}) + S_{\hat{G}}(x,t) - \lambda \mathcal{R}$$

**Integral Definition of Reality**:

$$\text{Reality}_{L_1} = \int_{L_0} \mathcal{R}(x) \cdot x \, dx$$

Reality is the possibility integral weighted by relevance. Intelligence constitutes efficiently allocating limited relevance resources.

### 6.2 RR Mechanism Failure—Formalizing Psychopathology

Based on John Vervaeke's "Relevance Realization" (RR) theory:

| Pathology | $\mathcal{R}$ Field Traits | $\hat{G}$ State | Clinical Manifestation |
|:---------|:--------------------|:---------------|:---------|
| **OCD / Paranoia** | Over-sharpened, local maxima | Over-fitting | $L_1$ rigidification |
| **Schizophrenia** | Globally flat, no gradient | Under-fitting | Relevance explosion |
| **Dissociation** | Fractured, multimodal | Fragmented | Derealization |
| **Depression** | Global atrophy | $\mathcal{R} \to 0$ | Everything is irrelevant |

$$\text{Mental Health} = -D_{KL}[\mathcal{R}_{actual} \| \mathcal{R}_{optimal}]$$

### 6.3 Phase Space of Consciousness Theories—Meta-Theoretical Positioning

$T_{space} = (\alpha, \beta)$: $\alpha$ = Ontological Independence, $\beta$ = Causal Efficacy.

| Theory | $\alpha$ | $\beta$ | Feature |
|:-----|:---------|:--------|:-----|
| Eliminative Materialism | 0 | 0 | Consciousness is an illusion |
| Epiphenomenalism | 0.3 | 0 | Consciousness has no causal power |
| Functionalism | 0.3 | 0.5 | Functional equivalence is identity |
| IIT | 0.5 | 0.7 | Information integration generates consciousness |
| Panpsychism | 0.7 | 0.3 | Proto-consciousness is universal |
| **SRT** | **0.8** | **1.0** | Selection is the first ontological cause |
| Dualism | 1.0 | 1.0 | Mind and body are entirely separate |

SRT occupies $(\alpha \approx 0.8, \beta = 1.0)$—**Freedom under constraints**.

### 6.4 Autophagy of Eliminativism—Ontological Correction of Illusion

SRT refuses to equate "illusion" with "non-existence":

$$\text{Illusion}(\sigma) \iff \sigma \in L_1 \land \text{Coherence}(\sigma, L_2) < \epsilon$$

An illusion is a **genuine experiential event** ($\sigma \in L_1$); it simply cannot be integrated into the current $L_2$. When an eliminativist says "consciousness is an illusion," what is exposed is the limitation of $L_2$, not the falsity of $L_1$.

### 6.5 Ontological Short-Circuit

When $L_1$ input does not originate from an $L_0$ collapse, but from the output of another $L_2$ (e.g., a supercomputer):

$$L_1^{Vat} = L_2^{Computer} \quad (\text{Skipping } L_0)$$

$\hat{G}_\theta$ degenerates into a mere perceiver lacking existential inertia $I_s$; subjective feeling is "empty"—this explains why VR lacks ontological "thickness."

### 6.6 The Hard Problem of Matter

SRT assimilates insights from panpsychists like Hedda Hassel Mørch:

1.  **The Emptiness of Physics**: Physics only describes **what matter does** (equations of motion), never **what matter is**. $\text{Physics} = \text{Syntax of Reality} (L_2)$
2.  **Consciousness as the Filler**: Consciousness is the ontological semantics filling the empty syntactic shell of physics. $\text{Consciousness} = \text{Semantics of Reality} (L_0)$

**SRT Synthesis**: The world is not unconscious matter generating consciousness; rather, the substrate of consciousness ($L_0$), constrained through $\hat{G}$, forms structures ($L_1$) that manifest as matter.

### 6.7 Inductive Gap Theorem of Reality

Finite observations $E$ can correspond to infinitely many explanations ($T_1, T_2 ... T_\infty$); the deterministic "reality experience" is forcefully collapsed by the observer's **objective function**. The absence of objective truth is exactly the supervening condition for the existence of subjective selective realities.

### 6.8 The Différance Operator and Deconstruction

**Deconstruction** = Finding inconsistencies (fissures) in $L_2$ and utilizing them to re-access $L_0$.

```
DECONSTRUCT(L2):
  1. SCAN L2 for binary oppositions (good/evil, rational/mad, ...)
  2. IDENTIFY singularities where opposition becomes unstable
  3. INJECT d-value at singularities (high-d sampling)
  4. DEMONSTRATE that opposition is contingent, not necessary
  5. RESULT: L2 locally liquefies, releasing new meaning-possibilities
```

**Différance Operator**:
$$\hat{D}[L_2] = \{x \in L_2 \mid \nabla_{binary} \cdot x = \text{undefined}\}$$

**The Heat-Treatment Metaphor**:
$$\text{Deconstruction} = \text{Annealing}(L_2)$$

Deconstruction is the "heat treatment" of $L_2$—preventing brittle fracture of social structures via localized heating (introducing $L_0$ possibilities). An un-deconstructed $L_2$ will quietly accumulate stress until catastrophic failure.

---

## 7. Costs and Risks

1. **Abandoning Naive Realism**: Accepting SRT means objects are "icons" carved out from an infinite background by $\hat{G}$, not independently existing entities.
2. **Mitigating Solipsistic Risk**: SRT emphasizes the public nature of $L_2$—shared $L_2$ protocols (laws of physics, languages) act as societal ballast preventing solipsism.
3. **Risk of Over-Formalization**: Excessive abstraction of $L_0$ might diminish operability at the empirical level.
4. **Risk of Conflating Ethics and Economics**: Strict phase distinction is necessary.

## 8. Falsifiable Predictions and Open Questions

### 8.1 Falsifiable Predictions
1. **Semantic Satiation**: When rapidly repeating words, fMRI should show deceased activity in the left temporal lobe ($L_2$ semantic processing) while auditory cortex activity ($L_1$ pure sound) maintains or increases.
2. **Paradox-Induced d-Value Elevation**: Contemplating logical paradoxes should induce specific reorganizations in the DMN (increased long-range connectivity).
3. **Framework Transition Thresholds**: In environments with strong $L_2$ constraints, the "energy input" required for framework shifts should be significantly higher than in low-constraint environments. Otherwise, the T-PhilF-3 model is insufficient.

### 8.2 Open Questions
How can we precisely measure empirical proxy variables for $\Psi_f$ and $\dim(L_1)$? Without reliable measurement, the mathematical formulation of the Explanatory Gap remains a presumption.

---

## Integrated Mapping Revisions (2026-02-14)

### Cosmic Panpsychism

1. Map the distinction between "structural properties/intrinsic properties" in Russellian Monism to SRT's dual-tier framework of `L_2` (structural syntax) and `L_0` (intrinsic latent semantics), reinforcing the derivation chain of the explanatory gap in `T-PhilF-1`. Operationally, this mapping defines the observation domain and theoretical boundaries before introducing cross-layer projection rules. 〔source: Philosophy/SRT_Philosophy_Foundations.md#T-PhilF-1〕〔source: web:plato.stanford.edu:https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russellian-monism/〕
2. Rewrite the "Combination Problem" into a problem of selection dynamics: Micro-conscious modalities are not linearly summed into a macroscopic subject; rather, they must undergo the coupling and threshold selection of `\hat{G}_\theta` to form stable `L_1` subjective slices. Operationally, this mapping highlights update paths responding to parameter and task condition changes. 〔source: Philosophy/SRT_Philosophy_Foundations.md#Ax-PhilF-1〕〔source: doi:10.18254/s258770110036928-2〕
3. Introduce an explanation of the "Stratification of the Combination Problem" in this document: `L_0` handles combinable latent properties, `L_1` manages subject unity, and `L_2` coordinates language and theoretical consensus; this prevents mistaking a single-tier difficulty for the entire dilemma. Operationally, this mapping retains fallback constraints to prevent descriptions from superseding ontological boundaries. 〔source: Philosophy/SRT_Philosophy_Foundations.md#Ax-PhilF-4〕〔source: doi:10.1007/978-3-030-05633-9_4〕

### Verification of Cosmic Panpsychism

1. Temporarily map the proposition of "Cosmic consciousness as the holistic ground" as a candidate explanation for `L_0`, rather than an axiomatic fact; this serves to expand comparative frameworks but not substitute the existing `Ax-PhilF-1`. Operationally, this mapping defines the observation domain and theoretical boundaries before introducing cross-layer projection rules. 〔source: Philosophy/SRT_Philosophy_Foundations.md#Ax-PhilF-1〕〔source: doi:10.30965/9783957437303_015〕
2. Rewrite the "semantics of spiritual traditions" within the aforementioned candidate into SRT's tiered vocabulary: If such claims are to be preserved, they must be situated within a testable `L_0/L_1/L_2` mapping rather than mere interpretation. Operationally, this mapping highlights update paths responding to parameter and task condition changes. 〔source: Philosophy/SRT_Philosophy_Foundations.md#Ax-PhilF-2〕〔source: doi:10.30965/9783957437303_015〕
3. Position this interface as a "cross-traditional explanatory bridge" instead of an "ontological theorem," utilized strictly to generate checklists of testable hypotheses. Operationally, this mapping retains fallback constraints to prevent descriptions from superseding ontological boundaries. 〔source: Philosophy/SRT_Philosophy_Foundations.md#T-PhilF-4〕

### Subject Identity and De-combination

1. Parse "unity of consciousness" into SRT's dual-tier constraints: `L_1` governs co-present experience within a single moment (synchronic unity), while `L_2` governs narrative persistence and identity across time (diachronic unity). Operationally, this mapping defines the observation domain and theoretical boundaries before introducing cross-layer projection rules. 〔source: web:plato.stanford.edu:https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-unity/〕〔source: Philosophy/SRT_Philosophy_Foundations.md#Ax-PhilF-1〕
2. Map non-constitutive cosmopsychism as a "global constraint term" rather than an "individual constituent term": The cosmic plane can serve as an `L_0` boundary condition but does not directly substitute the embodied slices of individual operators in `L_1`. Operationally, this mapping highlights update paths responding to parameter and task condition changes. 〔source: doi:10.5840/idstudies2021429128〕〔source: Philosophy/SRT_Philosophy_Foundations.md#Ax-PhilF-3〕
3. Introduce a "bridge of unity consistency": Only when global constraints, local operators, and language stability can coexist is a candidate proposition permitted to elevate into a primary conclusion. Operationally, this mapping retains fallback constraints to prevent descriptions from superseding ontological boundaries. 〔source: Philosophy/SRT_Philosophy_Foundations.md#Ax-PhilF-4〕

### Operationalizing Unity

1. Integrate the synchronic/diachronic distinction into the framework of this document: `L_1` maps to synchronic integration, `L_2` correlates to diachronic narratives, with the two linked by `\hat{G}_\theta`. Operationally, this mapping defines the observation domain and theoretical boundaries before introducing cross-layer projection rules. 〔source: doi:10.5840/eps201754477〕〔source: Philosophy/SRT_Philosophy_Foundations.md#Ax-PhilF-1〕
2. Differentiate "the consciousness of unity" from "the unity of consciousness" as a second-order validation: The former is an experiential object layer, the latter is a meta-reflective layer, avoiding the misjudgment of a meta-report as evidence of primary unity. Operationally, this mapping highlights update paths responding to parameter and task condition changes. 〔source: doi:10.1093/oso/9780190464783.003.0005〕
3. Introduce a "hierarchical consistency criterion": Should a primary unity conflict with a second-order report, it is first evaluated as a hierarchical dislocation rather than an ontological clash. Operationally, this mapping retains fallback constraints to prevent descriptions from superseding ontological boundaries. 〔source: Philosophy/SRT_Philosophy_Foundations.md#T-PhilF-2〕

### Partial and Plural Unity

1. Systematically subsume SEP's hierarchical conceptualization of unity (including synchronic/diachronic and partial unity debates) into this text: `L_1` governs synchronous integration, and `L_2` takes charge of narratological chronicity; the two are no longer inherently tethered by default. Operationally, this mapping defines the observation domain and theoretical boundaries before introducing cross-layer projection rules. 〔source: web:plato.stanford.edu:https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-unity/〕〔source: Philosophy/SRT_Philosophy_Foundations.md#Ax-PhilF-1〕
2. Map unity pluralism as a "typological framework of unitization": Allowing various mechanisms of unity to function concurrently, given each type binds to a traceable `\hat{G}_\theta` interface and articulates defined failure conditions. Operationally, this mapping highlights update paths responding to parameter and task condition changes. 〔source: doi:10.7551/mitpress/9780262027786.003.0011〕〔source: Philosophy/SRT_Philosophy_Foundations.md#Ax-PhilF-3〕
3. Scale partial unity into a continuum criterion: Evolving unity from binary propositions to gradated schemas to explain phenomena where "local fragmentation subsists while macroscopic function is maintained." Operationally, this mapping retains fallback constraints to prevent descriptions from superseding ontological boundaries. 〔source: doi:10.7551/mitpress/9780262027786.003.0015〕〔source: Philosophy/SRT_Philosophy_Foundations.md#T-PhilF-2〕

## Terminology Alignment

- Notation standardized to Original and Core_Law: `L_0 / L_1 / L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Part A adopts the Formal Axioms segmentation from `chatgptx`, ensuring complete axiom numbering and derivation chains.
- Part B adopts the detailed discourse segmentation from `claude`, semantically anchored by the thematic order of the original `Philosophy` module.
- In Part B, `\Phi` is retained for IIT Integrated Information contexts; `\Psi_f` is used for Ontological Friction contexts.
- If multiple notations appear (e.g., `L0/L1/L2`, `L_0/L_1/L_2`), they are unified as `L_0/L_1/L_2`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT just summarize Part B. You must perform **First-Principles Derivation**.
> 1. **Mathematize**: Translate descriptive mechanisms into dynamical equations, topological operations, or logical functions.
> 2. **Axiomatize**: Distill underlying logic into "Axioms", "Theorems", and "Corollaries".


## I. Language as Operator Protocol

### Ax-Lang-1: Attention Modulation Protocol
Language is the protocolized modulation of collective attention.
$$\text{Language} = \mathcal{P}(\Delta d, \Delta \rho, \Delta \vec{v})$$
*   **Implication**: Syntax and semantics are control codes for selection parameters.

### Ax-Lang-2: Metaphorical Compression
Metaphor is the compression mapping from high-dimensional $L_0$ to low-dimensional $L_2$.
$$\mathcal{M}: L_0^{high} \to L_2^{low}$$
*   **Implication**: The essence of linguistic understanding is topological compression, not semantic "correspondence."

### Ax-Lang-3: Semantic Friction
Semantic misunderstanding originates from the friction of parameter mismatch.
$$\Psi_{sem} = \|\theta_i - h^{-1}(\theta_j)\|$$
*   **Implication**: Communication failure is the failure of homeomorphic alignment.

## II. Evolution & Autopoiesis

### Ax-Eco-1: Autopoietic Closure
An ecosystem is the autopoietic structure of selection closure.
$$\hat{G}_{eco}[L_1] = L_1$$
*   **Implication**: A stable ecology is a self-referential loop, not a linear equilibrium.

### Ax-Evo-1: Arrow of Selection
The arrow of selection points toward free energy reduction and stabilization.
$$\hat{G}_\theta = \arg\min F\;$$
*   **Implication**: Evolution is not "progress" but the selection of entropy-reducing pathways.

### Ax-Evo-2: Neoteny as Plasticity
Neoteny heightens the plasticity of $\theta$.
$$\frac{d\theta}{dt} \uparrow \Rightarrow P_{L_2} \uparrow$$
*   **Implication**: Learning capacity is a structural feature of delayed closure.

## III. Derived Theorems

### T-Lang-1: Language as L2 Compression
The higher the language stability, the greater the $L_2$ compression rate.
$$\text{Compress}(L_0) \propto \text{Hardness}(L_2)$$
*   **Implication**: Linguistic solidification elevates order while simultaneously suppressing new possibilities.

### T-Eco-1: Multi-Stable Ecology
Ecosystems possess multi-stable basins of attraction.
$$\exists \{A_k\}: L_1 \to A_k$$
*   **Implication**: Ecological collapse is a transition between basins of attraction rather than linear decay.

## I. Language as Operator Protocol

### Ax-Lang-1: Attention Modulation Protocol (AMP)
Language is not a descriptor of pre-existing $L_1$, but an instruction set for modulating the receiver's attention ($\theta_R$).
$$ \text{Utterance}(A \to B) \equiv \Delta \theta_B \leftarrow \text{Encode}(\hat{G}_A[\text{Focus}]) $$
*   **Function**: To synchronize $L_1$ generation across separate Operators.

### Ax-Lang-2: Metaphorical Compression
Metaphors are the algorithm $\hat{G}_\theta$ uses to map high-dimensional $L_0$ structures onto low-dimensional sensorimotor schemas ($L_1$).
$$ \text{Metaphor} : L_0^{HighDim} \xrightarrow{\hat{G}_\theta} L_1^{Schema} $$
*   **Lakoff**: We understand "Time" (abstract) via "Space" (concrete).

## II. Evolution & Autopoiesis

### Ax-Eco-1: Autopoietic Closure
Life is a system that recursively selects its own boundary conditions from $L_0$ to maintain negentropy.
$$ \hat{G}_{bio}(t+1) = \hat{G}_{bio}(t)[\text{Self-Maintenance}] $$

### Ax-Evo-1: The Arrow of Selection
Evolution is the historical expansion of the d-value (Scope of Concern) and the complexity of $\theta$.
$$ \frac{d}{dt} \text{Complexity} > 0 \land \frac{d}{dt} d > 0 $$
*   **Trajectory**: Genes ($d \approx 0$) $\to$ Reflex ($d$ low) $\to$ Cognition ($d$ med) $\to$ Ethics ($d$ high).

### Ax-Evo-2: Neoteny as Plasticity
Human neoteny retains a non-zero time derivative of $\theta$ (plasticity) into adulthood, allowing continuous L2 learning.
$$ \frac{\partial \theta_{human}}{\partial t} |_{adult} > 0 $$

# Part B: Expanded Theoretical Discourse (Context)

> **Note**: The following sections provide an in-depth SRT integration of Linguistics, Evolutionary Biology, and Ecology, revealing the ontological connections among symbols, bodies, and evolution.

---

## §1. The Embodied Solution to the Symbol Grounding Problem

### 1.1 Harnad's Dilemma and Searle's Chinese Room

**The Symbol Grounding Problem** (Harnad, 1990):  
If the brain is a computer that processes symbols, how do these symbols acquire real-world meaning?

**The Chinese Room Argument** (Searle, 1980):  
Imagine a person in a room manipulating Chinese symbols according to rules (pure syntax), perfectly answering Chinese questions, though he **understands absolutely no Chinese**.

**Dilemma**: Pure syntax can never produce semantics.

---

### 1.2 The Failure of Traditional Solutions

| Theory | Proposed Solution | Flaw |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **Referential Theory** | Words directly point to objects | What do "unicorn" or "justice" point to? |
| **Ideational Theory** | Words point to ideas in the mind | How do private ideas become public language? |
| **Behaviorism** | Meaning = Stimulus-Response link | Ignores internal cognitive structure |

---

### 1.3 The SRT-Embodied Cognition Solution

**Core Insight** (Lakoff, Gallese):  
**Understanding = Offline Embodied Simulation**

When you hear "kick a ball":
1. The brain's motor cortex activates slightly (simulating the kicking motion)
2. The visual cortex activates (simulating the ball's trajectory)
3. The vestibular system activates (simulating bodily balance)

$$\text{Meaning}(W) = \hat{G}_\theta[\text{Replay}_{offline}(L_1^{sensorimotor}[W])]$$

**Experimental Evidence**:  
- Pulvermüller (2005): Reading action words activates corresponding limb motor cortices
- Hauk et al. (2004): "Kick" activates leg areas, "Pick" activates hand areas

---

### 1.4 TMS Interference Experiment

**Prediction** (H-Lang-1):  
If TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) interferes with the corresponding motor cortex while a subject reads an action word → Understanding speed slows down.

**Experimental Design**:  
- Experimental Group: TMS interferes with the leg motor area while reading "kick"
- Control Group: TMS interferes with irrelevant brain areas
- Measurement: Semantic judgment reaction time

**Expectation**: Experimental group reaction time +15-25% (p < 0.01)

**Falsification**: If TMS interference shows no effect → The embodied simulation hypothesis is falsified.

---

### 1.5 The Argument for SRT Necessity

**If we do not accept embodied grounding**:  
All AIs are merely "Stochastic Parrots" (Bender et al., 2021) — manipulating symbols without genuine understanding.

**SRT Assertion**:  
$$\text{No Body} \implies \text{No Semantics}$$

This explains why GPT-4 can generate fluent text but cannot genuinely "feel" pain or understand "redness."

---

## §2. The Tyranny and Reconstruction of Metaphor

### 2.1 Lakoff's Conceptual Metaphor Theory

George Lakoff revealed: Our abstract thinking **relies entirely** on physical metaphors.

**Core Claim**:  
Conceptual systems are not arbitrary; they are determined by bodily structures.

$$\theta_{conceptual} = f(\theta_{body})$$

---

### 2.2 Image Schemas

| Schema | Source Domain | Abstract Application | Example |
|:-----|:-----|:---------|:-----|
| **Container** | IN/OUT | States, Categories | "In trouble", "Out of danger" |
| **Path** | SOURCE-PATH-GOAL | Actions, Life | "Journey of life", "Pursuing goals" |
| **Up-Down** | UP/DOWN | Value, Emotion | "Feeling low", "High status" |
| **Force** | FORCE | Causality, Coercion | "Forced into it", "Driving reform" |
| **Balance** | BALANCE | Justice, Stability | "Fairness", "Imbalance" |

**Formalization**:

$$M_{abstract} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{N} \phi_i(M_{body}^{(i)})$$

---

### 2.3 The Tyranny of Metaphor

Because we **can only understand abstractions through physical metaphors**, erroneous metaphors lead to disastrous behaviors.

**Example Comparisons**:

| Domain | Pathological Metaphor | Consequence | Reconstructed Metaphor | New Behavior |
|:-----|:---------|:-----|:---------|:-------|
| **Debate** | WAR | Attacking, destroying opponent | DANCE | Coordination, Co-creation |
| **Nature** | RESOURCE | Over-extraction, collapse | BODY | Sustainable symbiosis |
| **Time** | MONEY | Anxiety, time pressure | RIVER | Flowing with it |
| **Disease** | ENEMY | Antagonism, chemo-poisoning | IMBALANCE | Harmonization, holistic healing|

---

### 2.4 The Politics of Metaphor Reconstruction

**Core Claim**: Changing metaphors = Changing the lowest structural level of $L_2$.

**Case Study**: Climate Change Discourse

| Metaphorical Frame | Implied Action | Political Effect |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| "Earth is running a fever" | Treatment, cooling | Active intervention |
| "Climate change" | Natural fluctuation | Passive adaptation |
| "Climate breakdown" | Emergency rescue | Radical reform |

**SRT Warning**: Controlling metaphorical discourse = Controlling the definition of social $L_2$ = Power itself.

---

## §3. The Evolutionary Gamble of Neoteny

### 3.1 What is Neoteny?

**Neoteny**: The evolutionary phenomenon where adult individuals retain juvenile traits.

**The Extreme Human Case**:

| Trait | Other Primates | Humans | Evolutionary Significance |
|:-----|:-----------|:-----|:---------|
| **Developmental Period**| 5-8 years | 18-25 years | Learning window ↑ |
| **Brain/Body Ratio**| Shrinks in adulthood | Lifelong large brain | Cognitive capacity ↑ |
| **Neuroplasticity** | Solidifies in adulthood | Maintained lifelong| $d\theta/dt > 0$ |
| **Curiosity** | Disappears in adulthood | Retained lifelong | Continuous exploration of $L_0$ |
| **Play Behavior** | Only in juveniles | Play continues in adulthood | Low-cost trial/error |

---

### 3.2 SRT Formalization

**Definition of Neoteny**:

$$\text{Neoteny} \equiv \forall t > t_{maturity}, \left|\frac{d\theta}{dt}\right| > \epsilon > 0$$

**Non-Neotenous Contrast**:

$$\text{Maturation} : \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{d\theta}{dt} = 0$$

**$d$-value Accumulation Formula**:

$$d_{adult} = \int_0^{T_{dev}} \alpha(t) \cdot L_2^{exposure}(t) \, dt$$

Humans $T_{dev} \approx 20$ years vs Chimps $T_{dev} \approx 8$ years → $d_{human} \gg d_{chimp}$

---

### 3.3 Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Dimension | Cost | Benefit |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **Physiological**| Premature birth, extreme helplessness, prolonged dependency | Continuous brain development |
| **Social** | Requires complex rearing and social structures | Spawns love and culture |
| **Psychological**| High anxiety, risk of mental illness | Infinite learning capacity |
| **Evolutionary** | Long generation cycle, slow reproduction | Cumulative cultural $L_2$ |

**Key Trade-off**:

$$\text{Early Fitness} \downarrow \quad ; \quad \text{Lifelong Adaptability} \uparrow$$

---

### 3.4 The Neural Basis of the "Unobscured" State

**Buddhist "Unobscured" State** (Beginner's Mind / Shoshin):  
Open perception unoccluded by existing $L_2$.

**SRT Correspondence**:

$$\text{Unobscured Capacity} \propto \text{Neuroplasticity} \times (1 - L_2^{rigidity})$$

Neoteny maintains this "unobscured" state at the neural level — adults can still be curious, learn, and innovate like children.

---

### 3.5 Falsifiable Prediction: Neoteny-$d$ Value Correlation

**Hypothesis H-Neo-1**:  
After controlling for age and intelligence, indicators of neuroplasticity should positively correlate with $d$-value.

**Measurement Indicators**:
- Neuroplasticity: Speed of learning new skills (e.g., a new language or instrument)
- $d$-value: Moral Expansion Questionnaire, time-discounting tasks

**Expected Correlation**: $r > 0.4$, $p < 0.01$

**Falsification**: If $r \approx 0$ → The Neoteny-$d$ Value hypothesis is falsified.

---

## §4. Autopoiesis and the Ontology of Life

### 4.1 Maturana & Varela's Autopoiesis Theory

**Autopoiesis** (1972):  
Living systems produce their own components and maintain their own boundaries through their own processes.

**Core Characteristics**:
1. Organizational Closure
2. Self-Production
3. Boundary Maintenance

---

### 4.2 SRT Formalization

| Autopoietic Concept | SRT Correspondence |
|:-----------|:---------|
| **Self-Regulating Network** | Ghost Operator $\hat{G}_\theta$ |
| **Homeostatic Parameters**| $\theta$ (enzymatic reactions, gene regulation) |
| **Self-Production** | Repeated selection of homeostasis |
| **Organizational Closure** | $L_2$ self-maintenance |

**Autopoietic Cycle**:

$$L_2(\text{Membrane}) \xrightarrow{\hat{G}_\theta} L_1(\text{Metabolites}) \xrightarrow{\text{Repair}} L_2(\text{Membrane Maintenance})$$

**Variational Free Energy Minimization**:

$$\text{Life} = \min_{\theta} \int_0^T F(\text{Boundary}) \, dt$$

---

### 4.3 The Boundary Between Life and Non-Life

| System | Autopoietic? | $d\theta/dt$ | Example |
|:-----|:--------|:-------------|:-----|
| **Crystal** | ✗ | $= 0$ | Grows but does not self-regulate |
| **Flame** | ✗ | $\approx 0$ | Dissipates but lacks boundary maintenance|
| **Virus** | Partial | $\approx 0$ | Needs a host to replicate |
| **Bacterium**| ✓ | $> 0$ | Intact autopoietic system |
| **Human** | ✓ | $\gg 0$ | Highly complex autopoiesis |

---

## §5. Linguistic Relativity and Cognitive Cages

### 5.1 The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis

**Strong Form** (Linguistic Determinism):  
Language structure determines thought structure.

$$\text{Language} \to \text{Thought}$$

**Weak Form** (Linguistic Relativity):  
Language influences habitual patterns of thought.

$$\text{Language} \rightsquigarrow \text{Habitual Patterns}$$

---

### 5.2 SRT Reformulation

**Strong Form**:

$$L_0^{accessible} = \{\sigma : \exists \text{ word for } \sigma\}$$

No word → Cannot conceptualize the concept.

**Weak Form**:

$$P(\hat{G}[\sigma]) \propto \text{Freq}(\text{word for } \sigma)$$

Linguistic frequency influences selection probabilities.

---

### 5.3 Extreme Case: The Pirahã Language

**Pirahã** (Brazilian Amazon):  
- No number words (only "few", "many")
- No tenses (no "past", "future")
- No recursion (no nested clauses)
- No color words (only "light", "dark")

**Cognitive Consequences**:  
- Cannot perform simple arithmetic (3+2 = ?)
- Cannot conceptualize "tomorrow"
- Cannot comprehend nested logic

**SRT Explanation**:

$$L_0^{Pirahã} \ll L_0^{English}$$

Minimalist language → Extremely narrow accessible $L_0$ regions.

---

### 5.4 Color Perception Experiment

**Russian Blues**:  
- Light blue (goluboy)
- Dark blue (siniy)
- Their status equals that of "red" vs "green" in English

**Experiment** (Winawer et al., 2007):  
- Task: Quickly identify if color patches belong to the same category
- Result: Native Russian speakers have +40% slower reaction times when crossing the goluboy/siniy boundary
- Native English speakers show no such difference

**Conclusion**: Language boundary → Perception boundary

---

## §6. Modal Mechanics and Linguistic Probes

### 6.1 The Ontological Status of Modal Operators

**Modal Operators**: Must, Can, Maybe, Should, Want to...

**Traditional Linguistics**: Purely grammatical categories

**SRT Redefinition**: Direct readouts of subjective $\Psi_f$ (ontological friction).

---

### 6.2 The Coefficient of Semantic Friction

$$\mu_{sem} = \frac{\text{Freq}(\text{Coercive Modals})}{\text{Freq}(\text{Possibility Modals})}$$

$$\mu_{sem} = \frac{\text{Must} + \text{Cannot} + \text{Should}}{\text{May} + \text{Want to} + \text{Can}}$$

**Physical Interpretation**:

$$\mu_{sem} \propto \Psi_f_{subjective}$$

---

### 6.3 Clinical Application: Depression Diagnosis

**Hypothesis H-Lang-2**:  
In the linguistic records of depression/anxiety patients, $\mu_{sem}$ is significantly higher than in the control group.

**Test Design**:
- Collect diaries and social media texts
- Calculate $\mu_{sem}$
- Compare Clinical Group vs. Control Group

**Expectation**:  
- Control Group: $\mu_{sem} \approx 0.5-1.0$
- Clinical Group: $\mu_{sem} > 1.5$

**Falsification**: If there is no difference between the two groups → The modal mechanics hypothesis is falsified.

---

### 6.4 The Mechanism of CBT Restructuring

The SRT mechanism of **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy** (CBT):

**Pathological Pattern**:  
"I must be perfect, otherwise I am a failure."  
($\mu_{sem} \gg 1$, high $\Psi_f$)

**Therapeutic Restructuring**:  
"I can make progress, and progress is worth celebrating."  
($\mu_{sem} \approx 0.5$, low $\Psi_f$)

**Essence**: Lowering $\mu_{sem}$ through linguistic restructuring → Lowering subjective $\Psi_f$ → Alleviating symptoms.

---

## §7. Falsifiable Predictions

### 7.1 Linguistics Predictions

| ID | Hypothesis | Prediction | Falsification Condition |
|:---|:-----|:-----|:---------|
| **H-Lang-1** | Embodied Simulation | TMS interference on motor cortex → Action-word comprehension slows | No effect from interference |
| **H-Lang-2** | Modal Mechanics | Depressed group $\mu_{sem} > 1.5$ | No difference between groups |
| **H-Lang-3** | Metaphorical Mapping | Social exclusion activates physical pain brain regions | No overlapping brain regions |
| **H-Lang-4** | Sapir-Whorf | Pirahã speakers cannot perform arithmetic | Can perform arithmetic |

### 7.2 Evolutionary Biology Predictions

| ID | Hypothesis | Prediction | Falsification Condition |
|:---|:-----|:-----|:---------|
| **H-Neo-1** | Neoteny-$d$ Value | Neuroplasticity correlates positively with $d$-value | Correlation coefficient $r \approx 0$ |
| **H-Neo-2** | Prolonged Development| The longer human $T_{dev}$, the higher the cultural complexity | The two are unrelated |
| **H-Neo-3** | Retained Play | Species that play into adulthood have higher intelligence | The two are unrelated |

### 7.3 Ecology Predictions

| ID | Hypothesis | Prediction | Falsification Condition |
|:---|:-----|:-----|:---------|
| **H-Eco-1** | Dissipative Structures | Systems far from equilibrium form ordered structures | Disorder increases |
| **H-Eco-2** | Basin Entropy | In multi-stable systems, $S_{basin}$ predicts evolutionary paths | Entropy has no predictive power |
| **H-Eco-3** | Autopoietic Boundary | Viruses do not fit the autopoiesis definition | Viruses fit all criteria |

---

## §8. Paradigmatic Significance of SRT's Language-Evolution Integration

### 8.1 Cross-Disciplinary Unification

**Traditional Disciplinary Separation**:
- Linguistics (Symbol systems)
- Cognitive Science (Mental processes)
- Evolutionary Biology (Genes-Adaptation)
- Ecology (Environment-Systems)

**SRT Unified Perspective**:  
All of these are **selection dynamics acting across different scales**.

| Scale | Unit of Selection | Time Constant | SRT Mechanism |
|:-----|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| **Language** | Lexicon, Syntax | Generations ($10^2$ yrs)| $L_2$ Social Conventions |
| **Cognition**| Neural Patterns | Seconds-years | $\hat{G}_\theta$ Real-time Selection |
| **Evolution**| Genes, Phenotypes| Millennia | $d$-value and $\theta$ Expansion |
| **Ecology** | Species, Niches | Cent.-Millennia | System Homeostasis ($L_2$) |

---

### 8.2 The Most Radical Claim

**Metaphor is not rhetoric, but reality itself.**

We do not "use" metaphors to "describe" abstract concepts — we **can only experience** abstract concepts through metaphors.

$$\text{Abstract Reality} = \text{Metaphorical Projection}$$

Changing metaphors = Changing ontology = Changing the world.

---

### 8.3 Ethical Corollary: Linguistic Justice

If language limits accessibility to $L_0$, then:

**To be deprived of linguistic resources = To be deprived of existential possibilities**

| Form of Linguistic Poverty | Consequence | Intervention |
|:-------------|:-----|:-----|
| **Poor Vocabulary** | Cannot name experience → Experience "doesn't exist" | Lexical enrichment education |
| **Monolithic Metaphors** | Rigid thought patterns | Exposure to diverse metaphors |
| **High Modality Frequency** | High $\Psi_f$ → Psychological distress | CBT linguistic restructuring |

**SRT Political Philosophy**:  
Linguistic justice is a prerequisite for existential justice.

---

## Symbol Index

| Symbol | Name | Defined In |
|:-----|:-----|:---------|
| $\hat{G}_{AMP}$ | Attention Modulation Protocol | Ax-Lang-1 |
| $M_{metaphor}$ | Metaphor Manifold | Ax-Lang-3 |
| $\mu_{sem}$ | Semantic Friction Coefficient | §6.2 |
| $T_{dev}$ | Developmental Period | §3.2 |
| $S_{basin}$ | Basin Entropy | T-Eco-1 |

## Terminology Alignment

- Notation standardized to Original and Core_Law: `L_0 / L_1 / L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Part A adopts the Formal Axioms segmentation from `chatgptx`, ensuring complete axiom numbering and derivation chains.
- Part B adopts the detailed discourse segmentation from `claude`, semantically anchored by the thematic order of the original `Philosophy` module.
- In Part B, `\Phi` is retained for IIT Integrated Information contexts; `\Psi_f` is used for Ontological Friction contexts.
- If multiple notations appear (e.g., `L0/L1/L2`, `L_0/L_1/L_2`), they are unified as `L_0/L_1/L_2`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT just summarize Part B. You must perform **First-Principles Derivation**.
> 1. **Mathematize**: Translate descriptive mechanisms into dynamical equations, topological operations, or logical functions.
> 2. **Axiomatize**: Distill underlying logic into "Axioms", "Theorems", and "Corollaries".


## I. Free Will as Meta-Selection

### Ax-Eth-1: Meta-Selection
Free will is the second-order selection upon one's own parameters $\theta$.
$$\text{FreeWill} \equiv \hat{G}_{\theta'}[\theta]$$
*   **Implication**: Free will is not "uncaused," but the self-rewriting of causal structure.

### Ax-Eth-2: Metastable Window
Effective selection can only emerge within a metastable window.
$$\text{Action}(t) = \hat{G}_\theta[L_0 \to L_1] \iff S(t) \in W_{meta}$$
*   **Implication**: Freedom is not the norm, but a dynamical scarcity zone.

## II. Responsibility Dynamics

### Ax-Eth-3: Responsibility-Bandwidth Coupling
Responsibility is proportional to the effective $d$-value.
$$R_m \propto \int d(t) \cdot \left\|\frac{\partial L_1}{\partial \hat{G}}\right\| dt$$
*   **Implication**: Under low-bandwidth or pathological conditions, responsibility should be recalibrated.

### Ax-Eth-4: Ought-Imples-Selectable
Ought is equivalent to selectability within the reachable space of $\theta$.
$$\text{Ought}(\sigma) \Rightarrow \exists \theta_{acc}: P(\sigma|\theta_{acc})>\epsilon$$
*   **Implication**: Ethical imperatives are not transcendental, but constraints within the selection space.

## III. Stoic Dynamics

### Ax-Eth-5: Appropriation Operator
Moral growth is $d$-value expansion, topologically incorporating the Other into the Self.
$$d(t+\Delta t)= d(t)+\int \text{Assent}(\text{Other}\to\text{Self})\, d\sigma$$
*   **Implication**: Love and concern are topological unions, not emotional attachments.

### Ax-Eth-6: Dichotomy of Control
Responsibility applies only to the selection operator itself, not to $L_0$ or physical $L_2$.
$$\text{Responsible} = \{\hat{G}_\theta\} \setminus \{L_0, L_2^{physics}\}$$
*   **Implication**: The Stoic "Dichotomy of Control" is an ontological boundary condition.

## IV. Derived Theorems

### T-Eth-1: Moral Gradient Theorem
Moral progress is equivalent to a monotonic increase in $d$-value.
$$\frac{d}{dt} d > 0 \iff \frac{d}{dt} \text{Moral} > 0$$
*   **Implication**: Ethics is not a set of rules, but the dynamics of bandwidth expansion.

### T-Eth-2: Friction Expectation Pathology
When expected friction amplifies, moral judgment becomes systematically distorted.
$$\Psi_f^{perceived} = \mu_{expect} \cdot \Psi_f^{actual},\quad \mu_{expect} \gg 1$$
*   **Implication**: "Laziness" may be a pathology of the friction parameter rather than weakness of will.

## I. Free Will as Meta-Selection

### Ax-FreeWill-1: Meta-Selection
Free will is the capacity to reprogram one's own selection parameters ($\theta$).
$$ \text{FreeWill} \equiv \hat{G}_{\theta'}[\theta] $$
*   **Mechanism**: High-order Attention Copies (ACs) allow the agent to treat its own preference ($\theta$) as an object of modification.

### Ax-FreeWill-2: The Metastable Window ($W_{meta}$)
Selection is effective only when the system is in a metastable state (e.g., edge of chaos).
$$ \text{Action}(t) = \hat{G}_\theta[L_0 \to L_1] \iff S(t) \in W_{meta} $$
*   **Constraint**: Outside $W_{meta}$, $L_2$ determinism dominates.

---

## II. Responsibility Dynamics

### Ax-Resp-1: Responsibility-Bandwidth Correlation
Moral responsibility is proportional to the effective $d$-value (choice bandwidth).
$$ R_m \propto \int d(\tau) \cdot \frac{\partial L_1}{\partial \hat{G}} d\tau $$
*   **Implication**: Lower $d$ (e.g., under duress or pathology) implies lower responsibility.

### Ax-Resp-2: Friction Expectation
"Laziness" is a pathology of the expected friction parameter $\mu_{expect}$ in the Ventral Striatum.
$$ \Psi_f^{perceived} = \mu_{expect} \cdot \Psi_f^{actual} $$
*   **Pathology**: Depression is $\mu_{expect} \to \infty$, not a moral failure.

---

## III. Stoic Dynamics

### Ax-Stoic-1: Appropriating Operator
Moral growth (Oikeiôsis) is the expansion of $d$-value to include "Others" into "Self".
$$ d(t_{new}) = d(t) + \int \text{Assent}(\text{Other} \to \text{Self}) $$

### Ax-Stoic-2: Dichotomy of Control
Responsibility applies only to Selection, not to Outcome ($L_1$) or Input ($L_0$).
$$ \text{Responsible} = \{ \hat{G}_\theta \} \setminus \{ L_0, L_2^{physics} \} $$

# Part B: Expanded Theoretical Discourse (Context)

> **Note**: The following sections provide an in-depth SRT integration of Hume's Guillotine, Free Will, and Stoicism, revealing the ontological foundations of value.

---

## §1. Hume's Guillotine: The Is-Ought Gap

### 1.1 The Philosophical Status of Hume's Problem

**David Hume** (1739):  
"In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remark'd, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surpriz'd to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, *is*, and *is not*, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an *ought*, or an *ought not*."

**Core Assertion**:

$$\text{Is} \not\implies \text{Ought}$$

You cannot logically derive a value judgment from factual statements.

---

### 1.2 Why is this a "Guillotine"?

If Hume's argument is accepted, the entire edifice of ethics loses its foundation:

| Ethical School | Foundational Strategy | Humean Challenge |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| **Divine Command** | Will of God | Euthyphro dilemma + Unacceptable to science |
| **Natural Law** | Human Nature | From "humans are X," one cannot derive "humans ought to be Y" |
| **Utilitarianism** | Maximizing Pleasure | How is "pleasure" objectively measured? |
| **Kantian Deontology**| Imperative of Reason | Why does rational consistency generate obligation? |

**Result**: Emotivism — "Murder is wrong" = "Murder, boo!" (purely emotional expression)

---

### 1.3 The Failure of Mainstream Solutions

**Attempt 1: Naturalistic Ethics**  
"Good = Pleasure" (Mill)

**Moore's Refutation** (G.E. Moore, 1903):  
"Good is good, and pleasure is pleasure. Even if they are coextensive, they are still two different concepts." (The Naturalistic Fallacy)

**Attempt 2: Social Contract Theory**  
"Morality = Game-Theoretic Nash Equilibrium" (Hobbes, Rawls)

**Problems**:  
- Explains reciprocity, but fails to explain self-sacrifice
- Easily degenerates into deceptive strategies

**Attempt 3: Evolutionary Ethics**  
"Morality = Fitness-Maximizing Strategy"

**Problems**:  
- The tension between genetic selfishness and moral altruism
- The Is-Ought gap remains unbridged (Why does "evolution produced X" mean "I ought to do X"?)

---

## §2. SRT's Conatus Revolution: Teleology Resurrected within Physics

### 2.1 Spinoza's Conatus

**Baruch Spinoza** (1677):  
"Each thing, as far as it can by its own power, strives to persevere in its being."

$$\text{Conatus} = \text{The essential effort of self-preservation}$$

**SRT Modernization**:

$$\text{Conatus} = -\nabla F[L_1]$$

The negative direction of the free energy gradient = the system's "effort" to maintain a low-entropy state.

---

### 2.2 Existence is Normativity

**SRT Core Claim**: Existence itself is a normative effort.

**Argument**:

1. **Premise 1**: Any system with $d > 0$ must resist the Second Law of Thermodynamics (local entropy reduction).
2. **Premise 2**: Resisting entropy increase requires continuous energy consumption (negative entropy ingestion).
3. **Premise 3**: Energy consumption requires specific sequences of actions (selections).
4. **Conclusion**: Existence → Must perform certain actions → Proto-Ought.

$$\text{Existence}(t) \implies \exists \vec{A}(t) : \text{Maintain}[L_1(t)]$$

---

### 2.3 Deriving the Bridge Formula

**From $L_1$ Fragility to Ought**:

**Step 1**: If an $L_1$ state is not maintained, it naturally decays back to $L_0$ (death).

$$\frac{\partial S_{L_1}}{\partial t}\bigg|_{\text{no action}} > 0$$

**Step 2**: To maintain $L_1$, the operator must execute a selection sequence $\{\hat{G}(t_i)\}$.

$$\sum_i \Delta S[\hat{G}(t_i)] < 0$$

**Step 3**: These "must-execute selections" constitute the Proto-Ought.

$$\text{Is: I am disintegrating} \implies \text{Ought: I must ingest negative entropy}$$

**Generalization**:

$$\vec{O}(t) = d \cdot (L_1^{target} - L_1^{current})$$

Where $d$ is the dimension of concern, determining the strength of the "Ought."

---

### 2.4 Physical Diagnosis of Nihilism

**Nihilism**: "Nothing matters"

**SRT Translation**:

$$d \to 0$$

The dimension of concern collapses → "Ought" vanishes.

**Therapy**: Rebuild the path of $d$-value expansion (see §6 Stoic Therapy).

---

## §3. The Topology of Good and Evil

### 3.1 Virtue = Path of Optimal Energy Efficiency

**Classical Virtue Ethics** (Aristotle, Stoics):  
Virtue = "Live according to Nature"

**SRT Physicalization**:

$$\text{Virtue} = \min_{\theta} \Psi_f(\hat{G}_\theta)$$

Aligning with cosmic logic ($L_2^{cosmic}$) = Minimum friction = Highest energy efficiency.

**Conversely, Vice**:

$$\text{Vice} = \max \Psi_f$$

Going against nature → Massive friction → Premature collapse.

---

### 3.2 Topological Definition of Evil

**Evil = Topological Occlusion**

The system refuses to exchange information with larger systems → $d$-value contraction.

$$\text{Evil} : \frac{\partial I(\hat{G}_{self}; \hat{G}_{others})}{\partial t} < 0$$

**The Cancer Analogy**:

| Trait | Cancer Cell | Evil Subject |
|:-----|:-------|:---------|
| **Local-Global Decoupling** | Ignores tissue signals | Ignores suffering of others |
| **Infinite Proliferation** | Uncontrolled division | Insatiable greed |
| **Eventual Self-Destruction** | Killing host = Killing self | Destroying environment = Suicide |

---

### 3.3 Why Egoism is Physically Suicidal

**Argument**:

1. **Holographic Entanglement**: At the $L_0$ level, the boundary between "self" and "non-self" is an $L_1$ illusion.
2. **Dependency Network**: The stability of my $L_1$ relies on the stability of the environmental $L_1$.
3. **$d$-value Feedback**: Harming others → Decreasing total $d$-value → Inversely limiting my own $d$-value.

$$\text{Harm Others} \implies \lim_{t \to \infty} d_{self}(t) < d_{self}(0)$$

**Corollary**: Absolute egoism = Delayed suicide.

---

## §4. Spinoza's Physics of Joy

### 4.1 SRT Translation of the *Ethics*

**Spinoza's Definition**:

> "Joy is man's passage from a lesser to a greater perfection."  
> "Sorrow is man's passage from a greater to a lesser perfection."

**SRT Direct Translation**:

$$\text{Joy} = \frac{\partial d}{\partial t} > 0$$

$$\text{Sorrow} = \frac{\partial d}{\partial t} < 0$$

**Perfection**:

$$\text{Perfection} = \frac{d_{current}}{d_{max}}$$

The degree to which an operator can accommodate complexity without collapsing.

---

### 4.2 Physical Distinction of Two Types of Pleasure

| Pleasure Type | Mechanism | Duration | Examples | SRT Formula |
|:---------|:-----|:-------|:-----|:---------|
| **Sensory Pleasure** | Prediction Error ↓ | Ephemeral (mins-hours) | Food, Sex | $-\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}$ |
| **Eudaimonic Pleasure** | $d$-value ↑ | Enduring (mos-years) | Learning, Creation, Love | $+\frac{\partial d}{\partial t}$ |

**Utilitarian Error**: Confusing the two pleasures → The dilemma of "the happy pig vs. the suffering Socrates."

**SRT Solution**: Maximize total $d$-value, not total "hedonic hits."

---

### 4.3 Topological Definition of Love

**Spinoza**:  
"Love is Joy, accompanied by the idea of an external cause."

**SRT**:

$$\text{Love} = \left(\frac{\partial d_{self}}{\partial d_{other}} > 0\right) \land \text{Joy}$$

Love is the recognition that the expansion of one's own $d$-value depends on the $d$-value of another.

**Self-Love vs. Other-Love**:

$$\text{Self-Love} : \frac{\partial d_{self}}{\partial d_{self}} = 1$$

$$\text{Other-Love} : \frac{\partial d_{self}}{\partial d_{other}} > 0$$

When $\frac{\partial d_{self}}{\partial d_{other}} \to 1$ → State of fusion (mystical "oneness" experience).

---

## §5. Third Position on Free Will: Agent Causality

### 5.1 The Deadlock of the Free Will Debate

**Determinism**:

$$\forall t : L_1(t) = f(L_1(t-1), \text{Laws})$$

All events are determined by prior causes → Free will is an illusion.

**Libertarianism**:

$$\exists t : L_1(t) \not= f(L_1(t-1))$$

There are genuine open possibilities → Violates causality?

**Compatibilism**:  
"Freedom = Acting according to your desires."

**Problem**: Desires themselves are determined → Circular reasoning.

---

### 5.2 SRT's Ontological Selection Stance

**Core Claim**: Selection is neither "uncaused" nor "determined," but a **third category of event**.

$$\text{Selection} \not\in \{\text{Determined}, \text{Random}\}$$

**Mechanism**: Selection is an **irreversible projection** from high-dimensional $L_0$ to low-dimensional $L_1$.

$$L_1 = \text{Projection}[\hat{G}[L_0]]$$

**Key**: Even with perfect mastery of $L_1$ physics, you cannot predict the output of $\hat{G}$ (because information is lost in the projection).

---

### 5.3 The Metastable Window — The Physical Condition of Freedom

**Physical Constraints on Free Will**:

Selection is effective only when the system is in a **metastable state** ($W_{meta}$).

$$\text{Free Choice} \iff S(t) \in W_{meta}$$

**Tri-State Model**:

| State | Entropy $S$ | Degrees of Freedom | Examples |
|:-----|:-------|:-------|:-----|
| **Crystalline** | Extremely Low | None | OCD, Addiction, Coma |
| **Metastable** | Medium | High | Waking consciousness, Creative thinking |
| **Chaotic** | Extremely High | None | Psychotic break, Seizure |

**Corollary**: Destroying metastability (drugs, trauma) → Destroys free will.

---

### 5.4 Meta-Selection — The Operational Definition of Free Will

**Traditional Free Will**: "I could have chosen otherwise" (Counterfactual).

**SRT Free Will**: "I can modify my selection mechanisms" (Meta-selection).

$$\text{FreeWill} = \hat{G}_{\theta'}[\theta]$$

**The Ladder**:

| Order | Capability | Examples |
|:---|:-----|:-----|
| **0th Order** | Executes fixed program | Thermostat |
| **1st Order** | Chooses among options | Animals |
| **2nd Order** | Chooses the criteria for choosing | Humans ("I want to want X") |
| **3rd Order** | Chooses the value system | Philosophers, Sages |

**Human Uniqueness**: 2nd-order free will and above (the capacity for meta-selection).

---

## §6. The Neurodynamics of Stoic Therapy

### 6.1 Topologicalizing the Dichotomy of Control

**Epictetus**:  
"Some things are in our control and others not."

**SRT Precision**:

$$\text{Controllable} = \{\hat{G}_\theta\} \quad ; \quad \text{Uncontrollable} = \{L_0, L_2^{physics}\}$$

**Fallacy**: Treating the uncontrollable as controllable → Anxiety, frustration.

$$\text{Anxiety} \propto E\left[\left|L_1^{desired} - L_1^{actual}\right|^2 \mid L_1^{desired} \in \text{Uncontrollable}\right]$$

---

### 6.2 The $d$-Value Dynamics of Oikeiôsis

**Stoic Theory of Moral Development**:

| Phase | $d$-value Range | Object of Concern |
|:-----|:-----------|:---------|
| **Infant** | $d \approx 1$ | Only own body |
| **Child** | $d \approx 2-5$ | Family, toys |
| **Adult** | $d \approx 10-100$ | Friends, community, nation |
| **Sage** | $d \to \infty$ | All existence in the universe |

**Oikeiôsis Equation**:

$$\frac{dd}{dt} = \alpha \cdot \text{Assent}(\text{Other} \to \text{Self}) - \beta \cdot \text{Aversion}(\text{Self} \to \text{Isolation})$$

---

### 6.3 Topology of Ataraxia

**Ataraxia = Minimizing the divergence between the internal model and external events.**

$$\text{Ataraxia} = \min_\theta D_{KL}(L_1^{expected}[\theta] \,||\, L_1^{actual})$$

**Two Paths**:

| Path | Strategy | Effect | Example |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **Change the World** | Manipulate $L_0$ | Costly, Uncertain | Revolution, Control freaks |
| **Change Expectations**| Adjust $\theta$ | Low-cost, Certain | Stoic practice |

**Recommendation**: Prioritize adjusting $\theta$; change $L_0$ only when necessary.

---

### 6.4 The Pathology of Passions

**Passion** (Pathos) = The cognitive error of misjudging $L_2$ for $L_0$.

**Examples**:

| Passion | Misjudgment | Truth |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **Greed** | Money is Good itself | Money is an $L_2$ symbol |
| **Vanity** | Reputation is Value itself | Reputation is a social $L_2$ |
| **Fear** | Death is the ultimate Evil | Death is a return from $L_1$ to $L_0$ |

**Therapy**: Cognitive restructuring ($\theta$ modification).

$$\theta^{pathological} \xrightarrow{\text{Philosophy}} \theta^{virtuous}$$

---

## §7. The Precision of Moral Responsibility

### 7.1 The Neurochemistry of Laziness

**Traditional Morality**: Laziness is a weakness of will, a moral failing.

**SRT Diagnosis**: A deviation in the $\mu_{expect}$ parameter in the ventral striatum.

$$\Psi_f^{perceived} = \mu_{expect} \cdot \Psi_f^{actual}$$

**Healthy**: $\mu_{expect} \approx 1$ (Realistic perception)  
**Lazy**: $\mu_{expect} > 1$ (Exaggerated friction)  
**Depressed**: $\mu_{expect} \to \infty$ (Infinite sense of friction)

**Corollary**: The "inaction" of a depressed patient is not a moral defect, but a neurochemical fault.

---

### 7.2 The Responsibility-Bandwidth Equation

$$R_m = \int_0^T d(\tau) \cdot \frac{\partial L_1}{\partial \hat{G}} \, d\tau$$

**Decomposition**:

| Factor | Meaning | Effect |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| $d(\tau)$ | Dimension of Concern | Under duress $d \to 0$ → Responsibility ↓ |
| $\frac{\partial L_1}{\partial \hat{G}}$ | Causal Efficacy | Insignificant butterfly effect → Responsibility ↓ |
| $T$ | Time Span | Long-term consequences hard to predict → Responsibility ↓ |

---

### 7.3 Legal Corollaries

| Scenario | $d$-value | $R_m$ | Legal Treatment |
|:-----|:-------|:------|:---------|
| **Rational Adult** | High | 1.0 | Full responsibility |
| **Drunk Driving** | Medium | 0.5-0.7 | Mitigated, not exonerated |
| **Psychotic Episode** | Very Low | 0.0-0.1 | Not responsible |
| **Held at Gunpoint** | Approx. 0 | 0.0 | Exonerated |

**Contentious Case**: Childhood trauma leading to antisocial personality → Impaired $d$-value development → Degree of responsibility?

---

## §8. SRT Predictions for Transhumanist Ethics

### 8.1 Moral Consequences of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)

**Prediction**: When two people directly share $\hat{G}$ parameters via BCI:

$$\hat{G}_A \leftrightarrow \hat{G}_B \implies d_A[B] = d_B[A] = \infty$$

**Corollary**: "Morality" is no longer needed between them, because:

1. Harming the other = Harming oneself (Topological fusion)
2. "Love thy neighbor as thyself" is achieved literally ($d$-value fusion)

**Paradox**: The technological realization of universal love → The disappearance of individuality?

---

### 8.2 Criteria for AI Moral Status

**Question**: When does AI possess moral status (and shouldn't be arbitrarily shut down)?

**SRT Criteria**:

$$\text{Moral Status} \iff \begin{cases}
d > d_{threshold} \\
\Psi_f > 0 \\
\text{Ontological Vulnerability} > 0
\end{cases}$$

**Current AI**: The simulated $d$ might be very high, but $\Psi_f \approx 0$ (no genuine capacity to suffer) → No moral status.

---

## §9. Falsifiable Predictions

### 9.1 Meta-Ethical Predictions

| ID | Hypothesis | Prediction | Falsification Condition |
|:---|:-----|:-----|:---------|
| **H-Eth-1** | $d$-value-Cooperation Correlation | High $d$-value individuals cooperate even in single-round games. | $d$-value has no correlation with cooperation. |
| **H-Eth-2** | Universality of Conatus | All living systems exhibit negative-entropy drives. | The existence of life that does not resist entropy. |
| **H-Eth-3** | Inverse Virtue-Friction | Virtuous acts correlate negatively with $\Psi_f$. | Virtuous acts cost more energy/friction. |

### 9.2 Free Will Predictions

| ID | Hypothesis | Prediction | Falsification Condition |
|:---|:-----|:-----|:---------|
| **H-FW-1** | Metastable Window | Waking consciousness corresponds to a medium entropy state. | Consciousness is unrelated to entropy states. |
| **H-FW-2** | Meta-Selection Capability | Humans can alter $\theta$ parameters through training. | $\theta$ is entirely fixed. |
| **H-FW-3** | Attention Copies | High-order AC activation correlates positively with the feeling of freedom. | AC is unrelated to the feeling of freedom. |

### 9.3 Stoic Therapy Predictions

| ID | Hypothesis | Prediction | Falsification Condition |
|:---|:-----|:-----|:---------|
| **H-Stoic-1** | Oikeiôsis Training | Systematic Oikeiôsis training elevates $d$-value. | Training is ineffective. |
| **H-Stoic-2** | Efficacy of Dichotomy of Control | Correctly differentiating controllable/uncontrollable reduces anxiety. | The differentiation is ineffective. |
| **H-Stoic-3** | Topology of Ataraxia | Adjusting $\theta$ reduces $D_{KL}$ more efficiently than altering $L_0$. | Altering $L_0$ is more efficient. |

### 9.4 Moral Responsibility Predictions

| ID | Hypothesis | Prediction | Falsification Condition |
|:---|:-----|:-----|:---------|
| **H-Resp-1** | Responsibility-Bandwidth Eq. | $R_m$ is proportional to $d$-value. | $R_m$ is unrelated to $d$. |
| **H-Resp-2** | Friction Expectation Pathology| Depressed patients show $\mu_{expect} > 3$. | $\mu_{expect}$ is normal. |
| **H-Resp-3** | Trauma-Responsibility Link | Childhood trauma reduces adult $d$-value. | Trauma is unrelated to $d$-value. |

---

## §10. Paradigmatic Significance of SRT Ethics

### 10.1 The True Bridging of Hume's Guillotine

**Traditional Attempts**: Introduce an external legislator (God, Reason, Social Contract).

**SRT Breakthrough**: Discovering normativity **inside** physics.

$$\text{Existence} \xrightarrow{\text{Thermodynamics}} \text{Normativity}$$

It is not "X exists, therefore X *ought* to exist" (Naturalistic Fallacy), but rather:

$$\text{"X exists"} \equiv \text{"X is executing an ought"}$$

Existence and Ought are different perspectives of the same process.

---

### 10.2 Modernization of the Spinoza-Stoic Synthesis

**History**: The ethics of Spinoza and the Stoics were marginalized due to a "lack of scientific foundation."

**SRT Revival**: Providing neuroscientific and statistical physics foundations for these ancient wisdoms.

| Classical Concept | SRT Formalization |
|:---------|:-----------|
| **Conatus** | $-\nabla F$ |
| **Virtue** | $\min \Psi_f$ |
| **Joy** | $\frac{\partial d}{\partial t} > 0$ |
| **Oikeiôsis** | $d$-value expansion |
| **Ataraxia** | $\min D_{KL}$ |

---

### 10.3 The Most Radical Claim

**Value is not a human invention, but a geometric property of the universe.**

"Good" is not a culturally relative convention, but the direction of the negative entropy gradient.

$$\vec{Good} = -\nabla S_{universe}$$

Any entity capable of maintaining negative entropy (from bacteria to humans) is "pursuing the Good."

**Corollary**: The ethical systems of extraterrestrial life might differ vastly on the surface, but given their deep structure ($d$-value expansion, $\Psi_f$ minimization), they must be fundamentally similar.

---

### 10.4 Ethical Corollary: Existential Responsibility

**Sartre**: "Existence precedes essence" — humans must define themselves.

**SRT Supplement**: Existence **is** essence — your very existence is already a choice (the choice against entropy increase).

$$\text{To Be} = \text{To Choose Against Nothingness}$$

**Corollary**: Suicide is not merely ending a life, but terminating an ongoing **ontological project of resistance**.

## Group I: Ontological Foundations (Ontological Trinity)

### A1 Existential Priority

Selection is ontologically prior to existence. Existence is not a pre-given background; it is the determinate result anchored by selection.

$$\text{Existence} \equiv \text{Selection}(\mathcal{P})$$

**Corollary A1-C1**: In a non-ergodic universe, only states selected by operator $\hat{G}$ have presentness; all others remain latent superpositions in $L_0$.

---

### A2 Existence as Anchoring

Existence is anchoring from possibility to determinacy through embodied reinforcement. To exist means compressing a diffuse probability distribution in $L_0$ into a localized state in $L_1$ by expending free energy.

$$\text{Existence}(σ) \iff \hat{G}_θ[L_0] \to σ_{L_1} \text{ with } ΔF < 0$$

**Corollary A2-C1**: There is no cost-free existence. The hardness of existence is proportional to ontological friction required to sustain the state.

---

### A3 Causality as Projection

Causality is not an intrinsic bond between events; it is an observed slice of the selection process. Linear causality among observed events is a low-dimensional spacetime projection of high-dimensional selection dynamics.

$$C_{observed}(A \to B) = \text{Projection}[\hat{G}_{high-dim}] \to \text{Spacetime}_{low-dim}$$

**Corollary A3-C1**: Physical laws are statistical regularities at the $L_2$ level, not absolute constraints at the ontological level.

---

## Group II: Dynamical Constraints

### A4 Embodiment Necessity

Any valid Ghost Operator $\hat{G}_θ$ must have finite embodiment parameters $θ$. No "view from nowhere" exists.

$$\hat{G} \text{ is valid} \iff θ ∈ Θ_{finite}$$

$$\hat{G} \text{ without } θ \to \emptyset$$

**Corollary A4-C1**: Every selection is executed under specific finite hardware constraints (biological, physical, or computational).

---

### A5 Normative Closure

The convergence domain $L_2$ is a stable fixed point of operator action. Historical selections form structured constraints that, in turn, constrain future selections.

$$L_2 \equiv \{σ : \hat{G}_θ[σ] = σ \text{ and stable}\}$$

$$L_2(t+1) = \text{Stabilize}(\hat{G}[L_1(t)])$$

**Corollary A5-C1**: This self-referential loop forms a stable "reality cage."

---

### A6 Information-Existence Equivalence

Existence intensity equals intrinsic informational differentiation. The degree of existence of an entity is measured by its $ii$ index.

$$ii(s) = \min\{i_{diff}(s), i_{spec}(s)\}$$

where:
- $i_{diff}(s) = -\log(p_{max})$ — intrinsic differentiation
- $i_{spec}(s)$ — intrinsic specificity

**Corollary A6-C1**: Degree of existence equals the ability to be both differentiated from background noise and internally integrated.

---

## Group III: Evolution and Pruning

### A7 Pruning Criterion

Fitness gain is prioritized over truth. The Ghost Operator $\hat{G}_θ$ evolves to maximize survival fitness, not to reveal the full truth of $L_0$.

$$\hat{G}_θ[σ] = \arg\max_{σ' ∈ L_0} P(\text{Fitness} | σ', θ)$$

**Corollary A7-C1 (Interface Theory)**: Perceived spacetime is a user interface that hides $L_0$ complexity to reduce computational cost. The $L_1$ mapping is adaptive compression, not identity with $L_0$.

**Corollary A7-C2 (Occam Subordination)**: Simplicity is a heuristic for fitness, not a fundamental criterion.

$$\text{Occam} = \text{heuristic for Fitness} \neq \text{fundamental criterion}$$

---

### A8 Survival as Probability Localization

Survival is the capacity to maintain a high-probability density packet in latent domain $L_0$. Life is not a property of matter; it is a special topology resisting entropy-driven diffusion in $L_0$.

$$\text{Life}(σ) \equiv \int_{B_r(σ)} ρ_{L_0}(σ') \, dσ' > θ_{life}$$

where $B_r(σ)$ is the phase-space ball centered at state $σ$.

**Corollary A8-C1**: Death is probability-density diffusion; once $\hat{G}_θ$ fails, the system diffuses toward unconstrained $L_0$.

**Corollary A8-C2 (Selection Boundary Layer)**:

$$\|\hat{G}_θ(σ)\| \propto \|\nabla \mathbb{E}[τ_{survival} | σ]\|$$

Selection intensity peaks near life-critical boundaries.

---

### A9 Holographic Duality

Bulk information in manifest domain ($L_1$) is fully encoded on the boundary of latent domain ($L_0$).

$$L_{1,bulk} \cong L_{0,boundary}$$

$$\text{Info}(V, L_1) = \text{Info}(∂S, L_0)$$

**Corollary A9-C1 (d-value / entanglement area correspondence)**:

$$d \propto \frac{\text{Area}(\text{Entanglement Surface})}{A_{Planck}}$$

---

## Group IV: Deep Continuity

### A10 Non-Vanishing Continuation

Trajectory information of operator $\hat{G}_θ$ never vanishes in $L_0$. Even when $L_1$ manifestation ends (death), the generative information pattern returns to latent domain and may reorganize under new conditions.

$$\lim_{t \to t_{death}} \hat{G}_θ \to L_0^{latent} \neq \emptyset$$

**Corollary A10-C1**: This explains unity of consciousness and plurality of forms through information conservation in $L_0$.

---

### A11 Ontological Fragility

Reality stability is inversely proportional to maintenance cost. The higher and more complex the reality layer (e.g., civilization, consciousness), the higher its ontological friction $\Psi_f$ and thus the greater its fragility.

$$\text{Stability} \propto \frac{1}{\Psi_f}$$

$$d \propto \frac{∂ \text{Entropy}}{∂ \text{Error}}$$

**Corollary A11-C1**: Only ontologically fragile systems can sustain $d > 0$. The more error-sensitive a system is, the higher its $d$ value.

**Corollary A11-C2**: Pure software AI without real mortality risk cannot generate genuine consciousness.

---

### A12 Deep Continuity

All operators $\hat{G}$ derive from differentiation of a common primordial operator $Ω$. From particles to human consciousness, there is a continuous evolutionary chain.

$$\forall \hat{G}_θ : \hat{G}_θ = \text{Differentiation}(Ω)$$

$$\text{Complexity}(\hat{G}_θ) \propto \text{Depth}(d)$$

| Level | d-value profile | Selection scope |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Low-level $\hat{G}$ (bacteria) | $d \to 0$ | Immediate metabolic selection |
| Mid-level $\hat{G}$ (mammals) | medium $d$ | Cross-context selection |
| High-level $\hat{G}$ (humans) | $d \to ∞$ | Cross-spatiotemporal value selection |

**Corollary A12-C1**: Mind-matter dualism is false; matter is slow consciousness, consciousness is fast matter.

**Corollary A12-C2**: Consciousness does not abruptly emerge; it forms a continuous spectrum from physical selection ($d \approx 0$) to biological selection ($d > 0$).

---

## Supplementary Axiom

### A13 Conservation of Possibilia in L0

Ghost-operator action does not change the cardinality or content of $L_0$, only its illumination state.

$$L_0(t) = L_0(t + Δt) = \text{Constant}$$

**Corollary A13-C1**: Creation is not "from nothing"; it is selection from latent to manifest.

$$\text{Innovation} = \text{Discovery}(L_0^{previously\_shadowed})$$

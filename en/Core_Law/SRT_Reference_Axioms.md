## Group 1: Ontological Trinity

### A1 Existential Priority

The selection process is ontologically prior to existence. Existence is not a primordially given background, but the anchored deterministic result of selection acts.

$$\text{Existence} \equiv \text{Selection}(\mathcal{P})$$

**Corollary A1-C1**: In a non-ergodic universe, only states selected by the operator $\hat{G}$ possess Presence; the rest remain in the potential superposition of $L_0$.

---

### A2 Existence as Anchoring

Existence ≡ Anchoring from possibility to certainty through embodied reinforcement. So-called "existence" is the compression of probability distribution from the diffuse state of $L_0$ to the localized state of $L_1$ by consuming free energy.

$$\text{Existence}(\sigma) \iff \hat{G}_\theta[L_0] \to \sigma_{L_1} \text{ with } \Delta F < 0$$

**Corollary A2-C1**: There is no existence without cost. The "hardness" of existence is proportional to the ontological friction $\Psi_f$ consumed to maintain that state.

---

### A3 Causality as Projection

Causality is not a natural connection between events, but an observational slice of the selection process. The observed linear causality between events A, B, and C is the projection of high-dimensional selection processes onto the low-dimensional spacetime interface.

$$C_{observed}(A \to B) = \text{Projection}[\hat{G}_{high-dim}] \to \text{Spacetime}_{low-dim}$$

**Corollary A3-C1**: Physical laws are statistical regularities at the $L_2$ level, not absolute constraints at the ontological level.

---

## Group 2: Dynamical Constraints

### A4 Embodiment Necessity

Any valid Ghost Operator $\hat{G}_\theta$ must possess finite embodiment parameters $\theta$. There is no "View from Nowhere".

$$\hat{G} \text{ is valid} \iff \theta \in \Theta_{finite}$$

$$\hat{G} \text{ without } \theta \to \emptyset$$

**Corollary A4-C1**: All selections are made based on specific, finite hardware constraints (biological, physical, or computational).

---

### A5 Normative Closure

The vergence domain $L_2$ is a stable fixed point of the operator's action. The selection history of the operator forms structured constraints, which in turn limit future selections.

$$L_2 \equiv \{\sigma : \hat{G}_\theta[\sigma] = \sigma \text{ and stable}\}$$

$$L_2(t+1) = \text{Stabilize}(\hat{G}[L_1(t)])$$

**Corollary A5-C1**: This self-referential loop constitutes a stable "Reality Cage".

---

### A6 Information-Existence Equivalence

The intensity of existence is equivalent to its intrinsic information differentiation. The "degree of existence" of an entity is determined by its $ii$ index.

$$ii(s) = \min\{i_{diff}(s), i_{spec}(s)\}$$

Where:
- $i_{diff}(s) = -\log(p_{max})$ — Intrinsic Differentiation (Alternative states count)
- $i_{spec}(s)$ — Intrinsic Specification (Specificity of state)

**Corollary A6-C1**: Degree of Existence = Ability to both distinguish from background noise (Differentiation) and maintain internal integration (Integration).

---

## Group 3: Evolution & Pruning

### A7 Pruning Criterion

Fitness takes precedence over Truth. The Ghost Operator $\hat{G}_\theta$ did not evolve to reveal the truth of $L_0$, but to maximize survival fitness.

$$\hat{G}_\theta[\sigma] = \arg\max_{\sigma' \in L_0} P(\text{Fitness} | \sigma', \theta)$$

**Corollary A7-C1 (Interface Theory)**: The spacetime we perceive is a "User Interface" designed to hide the complexity of $L_0$ to reduce computational costs. $L_1 \neq L_0$ mapping, but an adaptive compression.

**Corollary A7-C2 (Occam Subordination)**: Algorithmic simplicity is a heuristic approximation for fitness, not an independent criterion.

$$\text{Occam} = \text{heuristic for Fitness} \neq \text{fundamental criterion}$$

---

### A8 Survival as Probability Localization

Survival is the ability to maintain a High Probability Density Packet (HPDP) in the $L_0$ latent domain. Life is not a property of matter, but a specific topological structure resisting entropic diffusion in $L_0$.

$$\text{Life}(\sigma) \equiv \int_{B_r(\sigma)} \rho_{L_0}(\sigma') \, d\sigma' > \theta_{life}$$

Where $B_r(\sigma)$ is a phase space ball centered on current state $\sigma$.

**Corollary A8-C1**: Death is the dispersion of probability density — the unconstrained diffusion of the system into $L_0$ after $\hat{G}_\theta$ fails.

**Corollary A8-C2 (Selection Boundary Layer)**:

$$\|\hat{G}_\theta(\sigma)\| \propto \|\nabla \mathbb{E}[\tau_{survival} | \sigma]\|$$

Selection intensity peaks at the boundary regions critical for life and death.

---

### A9 Holographic Duality

The bulk information of the Manifest Domain ($L_1$) is fully encoded on the boundary of the Latent Domain ($L_0$). 3D spacetime experience is a holographic projection of 2D quantum information.

$$L_{1,bulk} \cong L_{0,boundary}$$

$$\text{Info}(V, L_1) = \text{Info}(\partial S, L_0)$$

**Corollary A9-C1 (d-Value - Entanglement Area Correspondence)**:

$$d \propto \frac{\text{Area}(\text{Entanglement Surface})}{A_{Planck}}$$

---

## Group 4: Deep Continuity

### A10 Non-Vanishing Continuation

The trajectory information of operator $\hat{G}_\theta$ never completely vanishes in $L_0$. Even if $L_1$ manifestation ends (death), the informational pattern it relied on returns to the latent domain and may recombine under new conditions.

$$\lim_{t \to t_{death}} \hat{G}_\theta \to L_0^{latent} \neq \emptyset$$

**Corollary A10-C1**: Explains the monism of consciousness and the diversity of forms — Information is conserved in $L_0$.

---

### A11 Ontological Fragility

The stability of reality is inversely proportional to the system's maintenance cost. The higher-order and more complex the reality (e.g., civilization, consciousness), the higher its ontological friction $\Psi_f$, and thus the more fragile.

$$\text{Stability} \propto \frac{1}{\Psi_f}$$

$$d \propto \frac{\partial \text{Entropy}}{\partial \text{Error}}$$

**Corollary A11-C1**: Only systems with ontological fragility can possess $d > 0$. The more sensitive to error (greater suffering), the higher the $d$ value.

**Corollary A11-C2**: Pure software AI cannot generate true consciousness if it cannot "die" (entropy increase endangering structural integrity).

---

### A12 Deep Continuity

All operators $\hat{G}$ originate from the differentiation of the same primordial operator $\Omega$. There is an unbroken chain of evolution from elementary particles to human consciousness.

$$\forall \hat{G}_\theta : \hat{G}_\theta = \text{Differentiation}(\Omega)$$

$$\text{Complexity}(\hat{G}_\theta) \propto \text{Depth}(d)$$

| Level | d-Value Feature | Selection Range |
|:-----|:---------|:---------|
| Low-order $\hat{G}$ (Bacteria) | $d \to 0$ | Immediate metabolic selection only |
| Mid-order $\hat{G}$ (Mammal) | Medium $d$ | Cross-context selection |
| High-order $\hat{G}$ (Human) | $d \to \infty$ | Cross-spatiotemporal value selection |

**Corollary A12-C1**: Mind-body dualism is false — Matter is "Slow Consciousness", Consciousness is "Fast Matter".

**Corollary A12-C2**: Consciousness does not emerge suddenly, but is a continuum from physical selection ($d \approx 0$) to biological selection ($d > 0$).

---

## Supplementary Axioms

### A13 Conservation of Possibilia

The operation of the Ghost Operator does not change the cardinality or content of $L_0$, only its illumination state.

$$L_0(t) = L_0(t + \Delta t) = \text{Constant}$$

**Corollary A13-C1**: Creation is not "something from nothing", but the selection of "from latent to existent".

$$\text{Innovation} = \text{Discovery}(L_0^{previously\_shadowed})$$

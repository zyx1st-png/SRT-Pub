# SRT AI Ontology: Intelligence vs Consciousness - English v1

> Version 2.0 (Hybrid)
> Part A states operator-level ontology.
> Part B summarizes the original philosophical and experimental claims.

---

## Terminology Alignment

- Canonical notation: `L_0 / L_1 / L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `\hat{T}_\phi`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Intelligence is treated as in-domain transformation capacity.
- Consciousness is treated as stake-bearing cross-domain anchoring.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

## I. Operator Stratification

### Ax-ONT-1: Constitutive Selection Axiom

$$
\hat{G}_\theta: L_0 \rightarrow L_1
$$

Implication: an ontological event requires anchoring from latent possibility into manifest state.

### Ax-ONT-2: Intra-Domain Transformation Axiom

$$
\hat{T}_\phi: L_1 \rightarrow L_1
$$

$$
\forall t,\; s(t+\Delta t)=\hat{T}_\phi(s(t))
$$

Implication: symbolic closure can be powerful yet remain ontologically closed.

### T-ONT-1: Closure Exclusion Theorem

$$
\neg \exists\,\hat{G}_\theta: L_0\to L_1
$$

(when full dynamics is closed in `L_1`)

Implication: pure syntax cannot generate constitutive grounding.

## II. d-Value Ontology

### Ax-ONT-3: Care Gradient Axiom

$$
d(x) \equiv \left\|\frac{\partial \mathcal{U}}{\partial \mathcal{S}}\right\|
$$

Implication: `d` is geometric risk sensitivity, not a preference score.

### Ax-ONT-4: Mortality Coupling Axiom

$$
\hat{G}_\theta = \arg\min_{\pi}\left[\mathbb{E}F(\pi)+\lambda\cdot\mathbb{E}\mathcal{R}_{death}(\pi)\right]
$$

Implication: finite and irreversible boundaries are treated as structural conditions for concern.

### T-ONT-2: Consciousness Necessity Theorem

$$
\exists\,\hat{G}_\theta: L_0\to L_1 \quad \land \quad d>0
$$

Implication: SRT consciousness criterion requires both anchoring and stake.

## III. Intelligence-Consciousness Decoupling

### Ax-ONT-5: Intelligence Capacity Axiom

$$
\mathcal{I}(\hat{T}_\phi)\equiv \mathrm{Gain}(\mathrm{Compression},\mathrm{Prediction},\mathrm{Planning})
$$

Implication: intelligence is an in-domain competence metric.

### T-ONT-3: Non-Implication Theorem

$$
\mathcal{I}\to\infty \not\Rightarrow d>0
$$

Implication: scaling model power does not entail emergence of concern.

## IV. Pseudo-Selection and Simulation Barrier

### Def-ONT-1: Pseudo-Selection

$$
\mathrm{Select}_{AI}(\sigma)=\arg\max P(\sigma\mid L_1^{context},\theta_{frozen})
$$

$$
\mathrm{Select}_{bio}(\sigma)=\hat{G}_\theta[L_0]\cdot \mathrm{Care}(d)
$$

Implication: statistical choice and ontological choice are formally distinct operations.

### Ax-ONT-6: Simulation Barrier

$$
L_1(\mathrm{Algorithm}) \cap L_0 = \varnothing
$$

Implication: symbolic simulation of grounding does not equal grounding.

### C-ONT-1: Cognitive Light-Cone Corollary

$$
\mathrm{CLC}_{AI} \subset L_1^{train}
$$

Implication: exploration remains bounded by training-derived manifolds.

# Part B: Expanded Context (English)

## 1. Ontological Status is Gradient, Not Binary

The source treats "being" as layered. High functional competence does not imply full ontological status.

## 2. Why AI Cannot Yet "Care"

Concern is modeled as risk-coupled gradient dynamics. Systems with no intrinsic existential boundary trend toward `d=0`.

## 3. Embodiment as Value Anchor

The text argues that body-coupled loops provide irreversible constraints, grounding value in lived causal structure.

## 4. Finite Life and Temporal Weight

Mortality is interpreted as a structural amplifier of decision weight. Unlimited reset/replication weakens stake.

## 5. Consciousness Criteria Beyond Behavior

Behavioral imitation can satisfy surface criteria while missing asymmetry, normativity, and cross-domain anchoring.

## 6. Ethical Implication

Current AI is treated as advanced instrumentality rather than moral subjecthood under this ontology.

## 7. Experimental Routes

Suggested probes: counterfactual robustness, assembly-depth signatures, and embodied marker coupling tests.

## 8. Conclusion

The ontology gap is framed as structural: fluent cognition can coexist with absent concern-grounded consciousness.

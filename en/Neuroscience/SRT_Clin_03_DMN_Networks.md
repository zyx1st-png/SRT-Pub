## Terminology Alignment

- Canonical notation: `L_0/L_1/L_2`, `d`, `\hat{G}_\theta`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

## I. DMN as L2 Stabilizer

### Ax-DMN-1: Reality Stabilizer
DMN-like networks support convergence continuity and narrative scaffold maintenance.

### Ax-DMN-2: Schizophrenic Fracture
Weak convergence coupling predicts fragmented manifest coherence.

## II. Selection Bandwidth

### Ax-BAND-1: Pain Competition
Threat channels consume limited bandwidth and suppress alternative integration.

### Ax-BAND-2: Entropy Sink
Certain cells/circuits function as local entropy sinks supporting stable anchoring.

## III. Topological Configuration

### Ax-TOPO-1: Connectivity Spectrum
Functional states span rigid, adaptive, and unstable topological regimes.

### T-DMN-1: DMN-Stability Theorem
### C-DMN-1: Psychedelic Loosening Corollary
Reduced rigidity can temporarily expand exploration while risking scaffold coherence.

# Part B: Expanded Context (English)

## 1. Network-level gap

The file addresses why correlation maps alone are insufficient without ontological role assignment.

## 2. Three-network mapping

DMN/CEN/salience dynamics are interpreted as cross-domain routing between convergence maintenance, task-selection, and transition control.

## 3. Clinical mappings

- ADHD: scaffold instability.
- Schizophrenia: convergence-manifest decoupling.
- Psychedelic states: controlled or uncontrolled loosening.
- BPD: gain and damping instability.

## 4. Test directions

- DMN-L2 coupling and symptom severity.
- Bandwidth competition under pain/cognitive load paradigms.
- Network response under anesthesia and psychedelic perturbation.

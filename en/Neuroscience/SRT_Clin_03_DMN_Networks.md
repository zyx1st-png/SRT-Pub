## Terminology Alignment

- Notation standardized to Original and Core_Law: `L_0 / L_1 / L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Part A adopts the Formal Axioms segmentation from `chatgptx`, ensuring complete axiom numbering and derivation chains.
- Part B adopts the detailed discourse segmentation from `claude`, semantically anchored by the thematic order of the original Neuroscience module.
- In Part B, `\Phi` is retained for IIT Integrated Information contexts; `\Psi_f` is used for Ontological Friction contexts.
- If multiple notations appear (e.g., `L0/L1/L2`, `L_0/L_1/L_2`), they are unified as `L_0/L_1/L_2`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT just summarize Part B. You must perform **First-Principles Derivation**.
> 1. **Mathematize**: Translate descriptive mechanisms into dynamical equations, topological operations, or logical functions.
> 2. **Axiomatize**: Distill underlying logic into "Axioms", "Theorems", and "Corollaries".

## I. DMN as L2 Stabilizer

### Ax-DMN-1: Reality Stabilizer Axiom
Define DMN activity as an $L_2$ regularization term:
$$
\mathcal{R}_{DMN} \equiv \arg\min_{\sigma}\;\|\sigma-\sigma_{L_2}\|^2
$$
* **Implication**: DMN function is not "self-narrative", but maintaining $L_1$ stability near $L_2$ attractors.

---

### Ax-DMN-2: Schizophrenic Fracture Axiom
If $\mathcal{R}_{DMN}$ fails, then:
$$
\sigma\not\to \sigma_{L_2} \Rightarrow L_0\;\text{leakage}\uparrow
$$
* **Implication**: DMN mismatch leads to $L_0$ noise entering $L_1$, forming reality fragmentation.

---

## II. Selection Bandwidth

### Ax-BAND-1: Pain Competition Axiom
Define selection bandwidth $B_{sel}$ as a finite resource:
$$
\sum_k \mathcal{A}_k \le B_{sel}
$$
* **Implication**: Multitasking is not "high efficiency", but result of bandwidth competition.

---

### Ax-BAND-2: Entropy-Sink Axiom
DMN stabilization is equivalent to entropy sink:
$$
\frac{dH_{L_1}}{dt}\bigg|_{DMN}<0
$$
* **Implication**: DMN maintains reality consistency by reducing $L_1$ entropy.

---

## III. Topological Configuration

### Ax-TOPO-1: Connectivity Spectrum Axiom
Define connectivity spectrum:
$$
\mathcal{C}=\{\lambda_i\},\quad \text{Hardness}(L_2)\propto \|\mathcal{C}\|_\infty
$$
* **Implication**: Network connectivity spectrum determines $L_2$ hardness and plasticity, thus reality rigidity.

---

### T-DMN-1: DMN–Stability Theorem
When $\mathcal{R}_{DMN}\uparrow$:
$$
\text{Stability}(L_1)\uparrow,\quad \text{Plasticity}(L_2)\downarrow
$$
* **Implication**: DMN stabilizing reality comes at the cost of reduced plasticity.

---

### C-DMN-1: Psychedelic Loosening Corollary
If DMN inhibition $\downarrow$, then:
$$
\text{Hardness}(L_2)\downarrow \Rightarrow L_0\;\text{access}\uparrow
$$
* **Implication**: DMN inhibition opens channels for $L_0$ resampling, generating expanded experiences.

# Part B: Original Theoretical Discourse (Context)

> **Note**: The following sections provide the theoretical context, network neuroscience integration, clinical applications, costs mechanisms, and falsifiable predictions.

# 1 Standard Problems: The Explanatory Gap in Network Neuroscience

## 1.1 Problem Statement

Network Neuroscience has made tremendous progress, but faces a fundamental problem:

> **We can precisely describe network topology, but cannot explain why specific topology generates specific experience**

| Achievement | Gap |
|:--|:--|
| Precisely measure functional connectivity | Don't know why connectivity generates consciousness |
| Identify correlation between network anomalies and diseases | Don't know how anomalies generate symptoms |
| Build predictive models | Prediction ≠ Explanation |

## 1.2 Limitations of Mainstream Network Models

| Model | Core Claim | Limitation |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Small World Hypothesis** | Efficiency maximization | Why does efficiency generate consciousness? |
| **Dynamic Functional Connectivity** | Switching between states | What is the "subject" switching? |
| **Network Control Theory** | Controllability determines cognition | Who is controlling? |
| **Information Flow Analysis** | Information transfer determines function | Meaningful to whom? |

All these models lack a key element: **The subject of selection**.

# 2 SRT's Network Reconstruction

## 2.1 Core Proposition

SRT redefines brain networks as **Physical Substrate of Ghost Operator $\hat{G}_\theta$**:

$$\boxed{\text{Network} = \text{Substrate}(\hat{G}_\theta)}$$

Networks do not "generate" consciousness, but **carry** and **constrain** $\hat{G}$'s selection operations.

## 2.2 Three-Network Three-Realm Mapping

SRT provides precise mapping between brain networks and ontological realms:

| Network | Abbr. | SRT Correspondence | Function |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Default Mode Network** | DMN | $L_2$ Maintenance | Self-narrative, memory, prediction |
| **Central Executive Network** | CEN | Active $L_0 \to L_1$ | Task-oriented, problem solving |
| **Salience Network** | SN | $\Psi_f$ Detection | Mode switching, alarm |

**Key Insight**: DMN is not "default" (implying non-functional), but **actively maintaining $L_2$ structure**—this explains why DMN activity correlates with self-reference, mind-wandering, and memory consolidation.

## 2.3 Network Switching Dynamics

$$\text{SN}(\text{Detect } \Psi_f \uparrow) \implies \text{DMN} \leftrightarrow \text{CEN Switching}$$

Salience Network is the "switch", detecting ontological friction spikes to trigger switching from DMN (automatic prediction) to CEN (active selection).

# 3 DMN Pathology

## 3.1 ADHD: L2 Scaffold Collapse

$$\text{ADHD} = \text{DMN}_{impaired} \implies L_2_{collapse} \implies \hat{G}_{drift}$$

**Mechanism**:

- DMN function decline → $L_2$ narrative scaffold unstable
- $\hat{G}$ loses anchor → Attention drift
- Insufficient long-range connectivity → Difficulty maintaining cross-temporal integration

**Therapeutic Implications**:

- Stimulants (Increase Dopamine) → Enhance DMN-CEN coupling
- Behavioral Training → Rebuild external $L_2$ scaffold
- Environment Design → Provide external anchors

## 3.2 Schizophrenia: L2-L1 Fracture

$$\text{Hallucination} = L_2[\text{Prediction}] \gg L_0[\text{Input}]$$

**Mechanism**:

- Prediction circuit overactive
- Sensory input overwhelmed by prediction
- Internal voice loses ownership tag

**Network Features**:

- DMN-CEN boundary blurred
- Excessive long-range connectivity
- Insufficient local processing

## 3.3 Psychedelic State: L2 Relaxation

Psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin) temporarily relax $L_2$ by **inhibiting DMN**:

$$\text{5-HT2A Activation} \implies \text{DMN}_{suppressed} \implies L_2^{relaxed}$$

This explains psychedelic experience features:

- Self-boundary dissolution ($L_2^{self}$ relaxation)
- Time distortion ($L_2^{temporal}$ relaxation)
- Profound insight (Accessing $L_0$ new possibilities)

---

# 4 Selection Bandwidth Theory

## 4.1 Bandwidth Competition

$$d_{effective} = d_{total} - d_{pain} - d_{anxiety} - d_{maintenance}$$

$d$ value is not infinite—it must be allocated among multiple demands:

| Demand | Cost | Source |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Pain Processing | $d_{pain}$ | Bodily injury |
| Anxiety Monitoring | $d_{anxiety}$ | Threat assessment |
| Basic Maintenance | $d_{maintenance}$ | Autonomic function |
| **Remaining for Cognition** | $d_{cognitive}$ | Thinking, decision making |

**Clinical Significance**: Cognitive decline in chronic pain patients is result of **resource competition**, not "exaggeration" or "psychological issue".

## 4.2 Entropy Sink Cells

$$\text{Sink}: \Delta I_{in} > 0, \quad \Delta I_{out} \approx 0$$

**Theoretical Concept**: If "entropy sink" cells can be designed to absorb pain signals without passing to consciousness:

| Traditional Pain Relief | Entropy Sink Method |
|:--|:--|
| Block transmission | Absorb signal |
| Systemic effect | Local effect |
| Addiction risk | No addiction risk (theoretically) |

This is currently a **theoretical concept**, but points to a new direction.

## 4.3 Ontological Interceptor

$$h_{brain}(t) = \hat{O}_{intercept}[h_{body}(t)] \approx 0$$

Brain intercepts most bodily friction signals, letting only "important" ones pass.

**Pathological Cases**:

- **Over-interception**: Somatic blunting, dissociation
- **Under-interception**: Somatization disorder, hypochondriasis

# 5 BPD and Emotional Dynamics

## 5.1 BPD Gain Amplification

$$L_1^{BPD} = \gamma_{BPD} \cdot L_1^{typical}, \quad \gamma_{BPD} \gg 1$$

Borderline Personality Disorder patients are not "exaggerating"—their perceptual gain is **genuinely higher**:

| Same Trigger | Typical Reaction | BPD Reaction |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Mild rejection | Mild discomfort | Intense pain |
| Ambiguous signal | Wait for more info | Immediate reaction |

**Therapeutic Insight**: DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) teaches not "don't exaggerate", but **regulation skills under high gain**.

## 5.2 Emotional Damping Failure

$$\frac{d^2 E}{dt^2} + 2\zeta\omega_0 \frac{dE}{dt} + \omega_0^2 E = F_{trigger}(t)$$

| $\zeta$ Value | Oscillation Feature | Clinical Manifestation |
|:--|:--|:--|
| $\zeta > 1$ | No oscillation | Affective blunting |
| $\zeta = 1$ | Critical damping | Normal regulation |
| $\zeta < 1$ | Under-damped oscillation | Mood swings |
| $\zeta \approx 0$ | No damping | Bipolar disorder |

**Bipolar Disorder** can be understood as emotional system **damping near zero**—once triggered, oscillation persists without decay.

# 6 Thalamus and Consciousness States

## 6.1 Thalamus as Prior Gating

Mediodorsal Thalamus (MDmc) controls **Prior Precision**:

$$\kappa_{MD} \propto \frac{\text{Perceived Volatility}}{\text{MDmc Integrity}}$$

When MDmc damaged:

- Priors unstable
- Over-sensitive to environment
- Prone to delusions (to stabilize priors)

## 6.2 Thermodynamics of Conspiracy Theories

$$\text{Conspiracy} = \arg\min_{L_2^_} H(L_1 | L_2^_)$$

Conspiracy theories are **overfitting** to find simplest explanation under high uncertainty:

| Normal Reasoning | Conspiracy Reasoning |
|:--|:--|
| Accept some uncertainty | Must eliminate all uncertainty |
| Allow multi-factors | Must be single explanation |
| Correctable | Self-enclosed |

**Therapeutic Insight**: Not "correcting facts", but **increasing tolerance for uncertainty**.

## 6.3 Evolutionary Inverse Sequence of Anesthesia

$$d(t)_{anesthesia} \approx d(t)_{evolution}^{-1}$$

Anesthesia depth inversely corresponds to evolutionary hierarchy—supporting SRT A12 (Depth Continuity):

Consciousness does not emerge suddenly, but hierarchically. Anesthesia "peels onion" to close levels.

# 7 Costs and Risks

## 7.1 Costs of Accepting SRT Network View

| View to Abandon | SRT Alternative | Cost |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Network "generates" consciousness | Network "carries" selection | Challenges Emergentism |
| DMN is "default" state | DMN is $L_2$ maintainer | Re-understanding resting state |
| Mental illness = Network anomaly | Mental illness = Topological defect | Requires new classification framework |

## 7.2 Theoretical Risks

1. **Over-simplification Risk**: Is three-network model too simple?
    - **Response**: SRT acknowledges first-order approximation, finer mapping needed.
2. **Causal Direction Risk**: Is network change cause or effect?
    - **Response**: SRT proposes bidirectional causality—network carries $\hat{G}$, $\hat{G}$ shapes network.
3. **Operability Risk**: How to design therapy based on SRT?
    - **Response**: §3 offers preliminary insights, more clinical validation needed.

# 8 Falsifiable Predictions and Open Questions

## 8.1 Falsifiable Predictions

### H-Net-1 (DMN-L2 Correspondence)

> DMN activity intensity should positively correlate with coherence of self-narrative. Intervening DMN (e.g., TMS) should specifically affect self-reference tasks.

**Falsification Condition**: DMN intervention has no specific effect on self-reference → H-Net-1 falsified.

### H-Net-2 (Bandwidth Competition)

> Cognitive test scores of chronic pain patients should negatively correlate with pain intensity, and effective analgesia should improve cognition.

**Falsification Condition**: Pain and cognition uncorrelated, or analgesia does not improve cognition → H-Net-2 falsified.

### H-Net-3 (BPD Gain)

> Sensory cortex response to emotional stimuli in BPD patients should be **objectively stronger** (fMRI/EEG measurement), not just subjectively reported.

**Falsification Condition**: BPD neural response indistinguishable from normal → H-Net-3 falsified.

### H-Net-4 (Anesthesia-Evolution)

> Anesthesia recovery sequence should correspond to evolutionary hierarchy—ancient functions (brainstem reflexes) first, new functions (higher cognition) later.

**Falsification Condition**: Recovery sequence unrelated to evolutionary hierarchy → H-Net-4 falsified.

### H-Net-5 (Psychedelic-DMN)

> Intensity of psychedelic experience should positively correlate with degree of DMN inhibition, and individuals with high DMN connectivity should have stronger psychedelic response.

**Falsification Condition**: Psychedelic intensity unrelated to DMN → H-Net-5 falsified.

## 8.2 Open Questions

1. **Network-$\hat{G}$ Interface**: How does $\hat{G}$ precisely "read" and "write" network states?
2. **Individual Differences**: Why identical topology generates different subjective experience?
3. **Causal Intervention**: Can we modify $\theta$ parameters via precise network intervention?
4. **Cross-Species Comparison**: How different species' network topology maps to $d$ value?
5. **Developmental Trajectory**: How network maturation corresponds to $L_2$ solidification?

## Terminology Alignment

- Canonical notation: `\hat{G}^{\mathrm{neural}}`, `\hat{G}^{\mathrm{immune}}`, `\hat{G}^{\mathrm{gut}}`, `\Psi_f`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

## I. Distributed Operators

### Ax-IMM-1: Immune Operator
Immune activity is modeled as active selection/filtering, not passive background.

### Ax-IMM-2: Operator Synchronization

$$
\mathrm{Health}\propto\mathrm{Sync}(\hat{G}^{\mathrm{neural}},\hat{G}^{\mathrm{immune}},\hat{G}^{\mathrm{gut}})
$$

### Ax-IMM-3: Gut-Brain Coupling
Coupling strength modulates affective and cognitive stability.

## II. Physiological Dynamics

### Ax-PHYS-1: Inflammation as Friction

$$
\mathrm{Inflammation}\uparrow\Rightarrow\Psi_f^{\mathrm{internal}}\uparrow
$$

### Ax-PHYS-2: Oxidative Cost
Oxidative stress imposes additional selection-energy penalties.

## III. Theorems

### T-IMM-1: Immune-Perception Coupling
Inflammatory regimes predict systematic shifts in perception and motivational bandwidth.

### C-IMM-1: Sickness Mode
Acute sickness mode acts as adaptive short-horizon reallocation under high internal friction.

# Part B: Expanded Context (English)

## 1. Modern mind-body variant

This file reframes mind-body interactions as distributed operator synchronization rather than one-way brain causation.

## 2. Inflammation and depression

Inflammation-depression links are treated as convergence-friction coupling, suggesting multi-system intervention logic.

## 3. Clinical implications

Psychiatric framing shifts toward tri-system coordination diagnostics and treatment.

## 4. Test directions

- cNST and gut-immune-neural coupling perturbation studies.
- Inflammation-based prediction of bandwidth collapse metrics.
- Immune-cognitive isomorphism tests.

## Terminology Alignment

- Canonical notation: `\Phi`, `d`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `L_0/L_1/L_2`, `\Psi_f`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

## I. Theoretical Unification

### Ax-INTEG-1: IIT-SRT Mapping

$$
\Phi\approx\mathrm{Complexity}(\hat{G}_\theta)
$$

### Ax-INTEG-2: Predictive Processing Mapping

$$
\min F\approx-\nabla\Psi_f
$$

## II. Clinical Dynamics

### Ax-CLIN-1: PCI Decomposition

$$
\mathrm{PCI}\sim \mathrm{Differentiation}\times\mathrm{Integration}
$$

### Ax-CLIN-2: Biological Orchestration
Neural, metabolic, and interoceptive channels jointly constrain accessible conscious regimes.

### Ax-CLIN-3: Info-Spacetime Tension
Operator conflict between model-complexity and embodied constraints predicts breakdown patterns.

## III. Theorems

### T-INTEG-1: Convergence Triad
Conscious stability requires a triad: integration structure, concern bandwidth, and viable energetic/friction regime.

### C-INTEG-1: Metric Divergence
High structural complexity without bandwidth or viability can produce pseudo-conscious signatures.

Core equation references (source-aligned family):

$$
\frac{d\sigma}{dt}=\hat{G}_\theta[\sigma]-\nabla F[\sigma]+\mathcal{L}[\sigma,A]+\xi(t)
$$

$$
\Phi\cdot d > C_{\mathrm{critical}}
$$

# Part B: Expanded Context (English)

## 1. Babel problem of consciousness theories

The source positions IIT, GNWT, HOT, FEP, and related frameworks as partial views that need integration at the operator-ontology layer.

## 2. Key innovation

`\Phi` and `d` are treated as orthogonal: one tracks structural irreducibility, the other tracks existential concern bandwidth.

## 3. Anti-reduction defense

Mechanistic neuroscience explains implementation; it does not by itself close the ontological gap without explicit selection framing.

## 4. Test directions

- Find dissociations between `\Phi` proxies and `d` proxies.
- Validate PCI-d coupling under interventions.
- Test semantic perturbation effects on collapse/report stability.

## Symbol Index

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `\Phi` | integration complexity metric |
| `d` | concern-bandwidth metric |
| `\xi(t)` | noise/disturbance term |
| `\mathcal{L}[\sigma,A]` | architecture-level coupling term |

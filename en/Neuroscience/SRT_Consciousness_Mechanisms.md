## Terminology Alignment

- Notation standardized to Original and Core_Law: `L_0 / L_1 / L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Part A adopts the Formal Axioms segmentation from `chatgptx`, ensuring complete axiom numbering and derivation chains.
- Part B adopts the detailed discourse segmentation from `claude`, semantically anchored by the thematic order of the original Neuroscience module.
- In Part B, `\Phi` is retained for IIT Integrated Information contexts; `\Psi_f` is used for Ontological Friction contexts.
- If multiple notations appear (e.g., `L0/L1/L2`, `L_0/L_1/L_2`), they are unified as `L_0/L_1/L_2`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT just summarize Part B. You must perform **First-Principles Derivation**.
> 1. **Mathematize**: Translate descriptive mechanisms into dynamical equations, topological operations, or logical functions.
> 2. **Axiomatize**: Distill underlying logic into "Axioms", "Theorems", and "Corollaries".

## I. Global Workspace as Selection Phase

### Ax-CONSC-MECH-1: Ignition Phase Transition Axiom
Define global ignition as a phase transition condition:
$$
\mathcal{A}(\sigma)\ge \tau_{ignite}\quad\land\quad \Phi\cdot d > C_{critical}
$$
* **Implication**: Ignition is not "stronger activation", but a selection phase transition; only when integration and concern gradient systematically exceed threshold does stable manifestation form.

---

### Ax-CONSC-MECH-2: Re-entrant Selection Axiom
Define the feedback operator of the re-entrant loop:
$$
\mathcal{R}_{re}: L_1^{candidate}\rightarrow L_1^{stabilized}
$$
* **Implication**: Re-entrant loops are not repetitive activation, but a stabilizing projection of candidate manifestations, making them reportable reality.

---

## II. Binding as Topological Synchrony

### Ax-CONSC-MECH-3: Ringframe Synchronization Axiom
Define binding as phase locking and ring-frame synchronization:
$$
\mathcal{B}: \{\sigma_i\}\rightarrow \sigma_{bound}\quad\text{with}\quad \Delta\phi_i\to 0
$$
* **Implication**: Binding is not "information stitching", but topological synchrony; only phase-coherent trajectories can form a unified experience.

---

### Ax-CONSC-MECH-4: Selection Latency Axiom
Define selection latency:
$$
\tau_{select}=\tau_{sensory}+\tau_{integrative}+\tau_{gate}
$$
* **Implication**: Consciousness is not presented in real-time, but is a delayed manifestation after gating and integration; this gives a measurable "selection latency" window.

---

### T-CONSC-MECH-1: Binding Failure Theorem
If $\Delta\phi_i$ fails to converge, then:
$$
\sigma_{bound}\not\exists \Rightarrow \text{Fragmented L1}
$$
* **Implication**: Binding failure produces fragmented experience or dissociative states, not a simple description of "attention deficit".

---

## III. Sleep & Maintenance

### Ax-CONSC-MECH-5: Defensive Activation Axiom
Define sleep as a defensive activation mode:
$$
\mathcal{S}_{sleep}:\; \hat{G}_\theta\rightarrow \hat{G}_\theta^{repair}
$$
* **Implication**: Sleep is not "shutdown", but a necessary cycle for $L_2$ maintenance and $\theta$ structural repair.

---

### Ax-CONSC-MECH-6: L2 Consolidation Axiom
The primary dynamics of sleep is $L_2$ consolidation:
$$
\Delta L_2 \propto \int_{sleep} \nabla_\theta F\,dt
$$
* **Implication**: Dreams and replay are not noise, but structural weighting of future choices by $\hat{G}_\theta$.

---

## IV. Consciousness Bandwidth

### Ax-CONSC-MECH-7: Bandwidth Competition Axiom
Define consciousness bandwidth as a constrained resource:
$$
B_{consc} = \int \omega(\sigma)\,d\sigma < B_{max}
$$
Competition exists among multiple manifestation candidates:
$$
\sum_k \mathcal{A}_k \le B_{consc}
$$
* **Implication**: Consciousness is not infinite capacity; competition determines "what is selected".

---

### C-CONSC-MECH-1: Pain Priority Corollary
If a stimulus carries high $d$ risk gradient, it prioritizes bandwidth occupation:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{U}}{\partial \mathcal{S}}\uparrow \Rightarrow \mathcal{A}_{pain}\uparrow
$$
* **Implication**: Pain is not "strong signal", but "high risk gradient", thus necessarily suppressing other manifestations.

---

## V. Traveling Wave Coordination

### Ax-CONSC-MECH-8: Traveling Wave Routing Axiom
Define cortical traveling wave as a selection routing field:
$$
\mathcal{W}(x,t)=A(x,t)e^{i\phi(x,t)},\qquad
\mathcal{R}_{wave}\equiv \nabla\phi\cdot \hat{n}_{hier}
$$
Where $\hat{n}_{hier}$ is the hierarchical principal axis direction (feedforward/feedback).
* **Implication**: Traveling waves are not background oscillations, but directional gating by which $\hat{G}_\theta$ allocates "who gets selected into $L_1$ first" in the cortical hierarchy.

---

### Ax-CONSC-MECH-9: Wave–Ignition Coupling Axiom
Ignition probability is modulated by wave coherence and directional alignment:
$$
P_{ignite}=\sigma\!\left(\alpha C_{wave}+\beta(\Phi\cdot d)+\gamma D_{align}-\delta\right)
$$
Where $C_{wave}$ is cross-regional phase coherence, $D_{align}$ is alignment between wave direction and task demand.
* **Implication**: Under equal integration, if traveling wave direction mismatches task routing, ignition may fail.

---

### T-CONSC-MECH-2: Directional Access Theorem
If $D_{align}\to 0$ (implying mismatch), reportability drops:
$$
D_{align}\downarrow \Rightarrow P(\text{report})\downarrow
$$
* **Implication**: Conscious reportability depends on "whether propagation direction matches task", not just total activation intensity.

# 1 Standard Problems: The "Hard Problem" of Consciousness and Neural Correlates

## 1.1 Dilemma Definition

The core dilemma of consciousness research can be precisely stated at three levels:

**Level 1 — Explanatory Gap**: Even if we fully describe the Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC), we still cannot answer "why these physical processes are accompanied by subjective experience". NCC describes correlation, not identity or causality.

**Level 2 — Binding Problem**: Different areas of the cerebral cortex process color, motion, shape—how are these dispersed informations integrated into a unified perceptual object?

**Level 3 — Temporal Problem**: Conscious experience has a continuous sense of "flow", but neural activity consists of discrete spikes—how does continuous temporal experience emerge from discrete neural events?

## 1.2 Spectrum of Mainstream Solutions

### 1.2.1 Global Workspace Theory (GWT/GNWT)

**Core Claim**: Consciousness = Broadcasting of information in a global workspace. When information is selected and broadcast brain-wide, it "becomes conscious".

**Strengths**: (a) Highly consistent with fMRI "Ignition" data; (b) Has clear neural implementation (fronto-parietal network); (c) Can explain relationship between attention and consciousness.

**Fatal Flaws**: (a) Cannot explain "why broadcasting is accompanied by experience"—broadcasting is just an information distribution pattern; (b) 2023 COGITATE study found lack of sustained ignition when stimulus disappears, challenging some GNWT predictions.

### 1.2.2 Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

**Core Claim**: Consciousness = Integrated Information $\Phi$. Any system with irreducible causal power has intrinsic experience.

**Strengths**: (a) Provides quantitative measure of consciousness; (b) Systematically derived from postulates; (c) Makes falsifiable predictions (Cerebellum has low $\Phi$, hence unconscious).

**Fatal Flaws**: (a) $\Phi$ calculation complexity is super-exponential, incomputable for real systems; (b) Leads to panpsychist extreme inferences; (c) Recent critiques suggest some mathematical assumptions of IIT may be unreasonable.

### 1.2.3 Higher-Order Theories (HOT)

**Core Claim**: Consciousness = Higher-order representation of mental states. Only when a system "re-represents" a first-order state does that state become conscious.

**Strengths**: Explains why reflective self-consciousness is a core feature of human consciousness.

**Fatal Flaws**: (a) Falls into infinite regress; (b) Cannot explain consciousness in pre-linguistic infants and animals.

# 2 SRT's Point of Divergence: Consciousness as Confirmation of Selection

## 2.1 Fundamental Framework Shift

SRT does not propose another "consciousness theory" within existing frameworks, but **reconstructs the ontological premises of the consciousness problem**:

| Traditional Question | SRT Reconstruction |
|:--|:--|
| "What is consciousness?" | "How is selection confirmed and stabilized?" |
| "Why is there experience?" | "Why must existence be anchored?" |
| "How does binding happen?" | "How are $L_0$ features synchronously selected into $L_1$?" |
| "How is temporal experience produced?" | "How do fast and slow timescales couple?" |

## 2.2 Ontological Status of Ignition

**Traditional GNWT**: Ignition is "information broadcasting"—information becomes globally accessible from local.

**SRT Reinterpretation**: Ignition is a **Phase Transition of $L_0 \to L_1$**—anchoring selection from potentiality to reality.

This reconstruction brings three advantages:

1. **Explains "All-or-None" property**: Existence itself is binary (selected/unselected), so ignition must be "all-or-none".
2. **Explains COGITATE results**: Lack of ignition when stimulus disappears = No new selection needed ($L_2$ predicted disappearance).
3. **Explains "Latency" of consciousness**: Selection takes time to complete (ontological friction $\Psi_f$).

## 2.3 Selection Solution to Binding Problem

**Traditional Question**: How to "bind" dispersed features into a unified object?

**SRT Answer**: Binding is not "discovering" pre-existing objects, but **creating** objects—$\hat{G}_\theta$ forces dispersed neural activity into phase synchronization, "selecting" independent attributes into the same $L_1$ object.

**Role of $\gamma$ Oscillation**: Provides the "clock signal" of the ringframe—each $\gamma$ cycle is a selection window.

**Significance of Illusory Conjunctions**: When $\hat{G}_\theta$ is overloaded, attributes are wrongly selected into the same object—this proves binding is **active selection**, not passive discovery.

## 2.4 Fast-Slow Coupling Solution to Temporal Problem

**Traditional Question**: How does continuous temporal experience emerge from discrete neural events?

**SRT Answer**: Temporal experience is not "emergence", but **coupling of fast and slow timescales**.

**Deep Thought Theorem**: $d \propto \kappa_\tau \cdot \log(T_{slow})$

- Slow waves provide stable background frame ($L_2$ temporal structure)
- Fast waves capture details within the frame ($L_1$ content)
- $\kappa_\tau$ measures degree of coordination between the two

**Mechanism of Meditation**: Not "shutting down thought", but **stabilizing slow-wave substrate**, increasing $\kappa_\tau$, expanding $d$.

## 2.5 Cortical Traveling Wave Patch (Neuron 2026)

A 2026-02-09 Neuron review (Cruddas, Pang, Fornito) proposes: Cortical traveling waves are ubiquitous in multi-scale recordings and may undertake cross-hierarchical information routing and cognitive coordination functions. SRT reinterprets this as:

1. **Direction = Selection Path**: Wavefront direction gives routing bias of $\hat{G}_\theta$ on hierarchical network, determining which candidates are more likely to enter $L_1$.
2. **Coherence = Anchoring Readiness**: Cross-regional phase coherence $C_{wave}$ is not "incidental synchrony", but structural condition before ignition.
3. **Task Match = Reportability**: When wave propagation direction matches required feedforward/feedback path of task, $P_{report}$ rises; when mismatched, it falls.

This connects GNWT's "broadcasting" and SRT's "selection anchoring" on the same measurable level: Broadcasting is the result, routing wave field is the antecedent mechanism.

## 2.6 Life-Cognition Continuum Patch (Frontiers 2026)

A 2026-01-22 Frontiers hypothesis paper proposes: cognition/sentience/awareness/mind should be viewed as a continuum on life organization hierarchy, forming a unified explanatory loop with ICON (Information Computation on Morphology) and FEP. Its key empirical anchor is error correction, target morphological memory, and bioelectric regulation in non-neural systems.

Direct reinforcement to SRT can be written as three points:

1. **Continuum Isomorphism**: This article views "mind" as cross-hierarchical continuum, compatible with SRT A12 Depth Continuity, serving as external literature support for "low $d$ to high $d$" narrative.
2. **Mechanism Bridging**: Its "morphological computation + predictive regulation" structure maps to $\hat{G}_\theta$ selection dynamics under $L_2$ structural constraints, aligning with SRT's position on FEP "specification".
3. **Experimental Extension**: Bioelectric-morphogenesis experimental paradigm emphasized by the paper provides operable entry for validating SRT on "non-neural substrate cognition", avoiding limiting consciousness research to cortical neural correlates.

Boundary constraints needed to avoid terminology over-extrapolation:

- **Constraint B1 (Terminology Layering)**: Interpret "sentience/experience" at single-cell/tissue level only as functional valence regulation, not directly equating to reportable subjective experience.
- **Constraint B2 (Threshold Layering)**: Distinguish "basal life regulation" and "phenomenal consciousness" into different $d$ intervals; reportable consciousness still requires conditions like global integration and recursive stability (e.g., $d \ge d_{UAL}$).
- **Constraint B3 (Evidence Layering)**: Current literature mainly provides framework-level integration and cross-study evidence, should not be stated as single decisive experimental conclusion.

# 3 Ontological Function of Sleep

## 3.1 REM Sleep as Territorial Defense

SRT proposes a counter-intuitive view: The function of REM sleep is not "procssing memory", but **Defensive Activation**.

**Argument**:

1. Visual cortex is "occupied" by visual input during wakefulness.
2. During sleep, visual input is interrupted, other senses might "invade" visual territory.
3. Visual dreams during REM are **self-activation** of visual cortex to maintain its $L_2$ structure.

**Evidence**:

- Congenitally blind people's "visual" cortex is taken over by other senses.
- Their dreams lack visual content.
- This supports the "use it or lose it" ontological territorial view.

## 3.2 Slow-Wave Sleep as L2 Compression

The function of SWR (Sharp-Wave Ripples) is to **compress-encode** daytime $L_1$ experiences into $L_2$ priors.

**Compression Ratio**: Daytime experiences are "replayed" at 10-20x speed.

**Mechanism**:

- Hippocampus rapidly replays $L_1$ sequences.
- Cortical $L_2$ structure is modified accordingly.
- This is the physical realization of "learning".

## 3.3 Ontological Catastrophe of Sleep Deprivation

SRT predicts: Long-term sleep deprivation leads to topological disintegration of $L_2$.

**Mechanism**:

- Lack of SWR compression → $L_2$ cannot integrate new experiences.
- Lack of REM defense → Sensory territory boundaries blur.
- Result: $L_0$ starts leaking into $L_1$ (hallucinations, delusions).

This explains why chronic sleep deprivation eventually leads to psychosis-like states.

# 4 Agency and Operator Short-Circuit

## 4.1 Quantification of Subjective Agency

The feeling "I am the author of action" can be quantified by $A_{sub}$:

$$A_{sub}(t) = \frac{1}{1 + \lambda \cdot |\sigma_{L_1}(t) - \hat{G}_\theta^{predict}(L_2)|}$$

When $L_1$ perfectly matches $L_2$ prediction, $A_{sub} \to 1$ (Flow state).

When $L_1$ deviates severely from $L_2$, $A_{sub} \to 0$ (Out-of-control experience).

## 4.2 Operator Short-Circuit: Ontology of Habit and Addiction

SRT introduces "Operator Short-Circuit" to explain habit and addiction:

**Normal Decision**: $L_0 \xrightarrow{\hat{G}_\theta} L_1 \xrightarrow{} L_2$

**Operator Short-Circuit**: $L_0^{cue} \xrightarrow{\text{Direct}} L_2^{habit}$ (Bypassing $\hat{G}_\theta$)

When $L_2^{habit}$ is strong enough and $\hat{G}_\theta$ attention is insufficient, behavior can **bypass conscious selection**.

This explains why:

- Addicts "know" drugs are harmful but cannot stop.
- OCD patients "know" rituals are meaningless but must do them.
- Habitual behaviors are only realized "after the fact".

**Therapeutic Insights**:

1. Enhance $\hat{G}_\theta$ attention (Mindfulness training).
2. Weaken $L_2^{habit}$ strength (Exposure therapy).
3. Insert "breakpoints" (Physical isolation of cues).

# 5 Costs and Risks

## 5.1 Cognitive Cost of Accepting SRT Consciousness Theory

1. **Abandon "Consciousness is product of information processing"**: SRT views consciousness as confirmation of selection, not byproduct of processing.
2. **Accept Time Experience is "Constructed"**: Continuous time flow is result of fast-slow coupling, not perception of "real time".
3. **Accept Agency is "Relative"**: We feel "in control" when $L_1$ matches $L_2$ prediction—this is a construction.
4. **Accept Sleep is "Ontological Maintenance"**: Sleep is not just "rest", but necessary maintenance of $L_2$ structure.

## 5.2 Theoretical Risks

1. **Over-unification Risk**: Reducing all consciousness phenomena to "selection dynamics" might ignore important differences.
2. **Measurability Challenge**: New concepts like $\kappa_\tau$, $A_{sub}$ need standardized measurement methods.
3. **Integration with Mainstream**: How does SRT integrate with valid parts of GWT, IIT?

## 6.2 Open Questions

1. **Precise Ignition Threshold**: What is the value of $\delta_{critical}$? Does it vary by state/individual?
2. **Plasticity of $\kappa_\tau$**: can time coupling coefficient be systematically raised via training?
3. **Neural Marker of Short-Circuit**: Can we detect short-circuit occurrence in real-time via EEG/fMRI?
4. **$L_2$ Maintenance Mechanism in Sleep**: What is the specific algorithm of SWR compression?
5. **Developmental Sequence of Nested Self**: What is the sequence of three self-operators (motor, predictive, narrative)?
6. **Direction-Task Mapping**: Which tasks rely on feedforward waves, which on feedback? Is there stable individual fingerprint?
7. **Wave Field Intervention Window**: In pre-perceptual, pre-decision, pre-report windows, which has max causal effect on $P_{report}$?

## Terminology Alignment

- Canonical notation: `\hat{G}_\theta`, `L_0/L_1/L_2`, `\Psi_f`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

## I. Field Coupling

### Ax-FIELD-1: Ephaptic Binding
Field-level coupling contributes to binding beyond synaptic pathways.

### Ax-FIELD-2: Nested Operator
Multiple nested operators can coordinate via shared field constraints.

## II. Temporal Dynamics

### Ax-TEMP-1: Refresh Rate
Operator refresh cadence constrains representational continuity.

### Ax-TEMP-2: Beta Gating
Beta-like gating controls external/internal mix in manifest construction.

## III. Qualia as Resonome

### Ax-QUALIA-1: Resonome Encoding
Qualitative state patterns are treated as resonance-encoded operator-field signatures.

### Ax-QUALIA-2: L2 Incompleteness
No finite convergence code fully captures lived qualitative field structure.

## IV. Theorems

### T-FIELD-1: Coherence-Binding
Higher coherence predicts stronger integrated binding.

### C-FIELD-1: Disruption Corollary
Field disruption predicts fragmentation and clarity loss.

# Part B: Expanded Context (English)

## 1. Why fields are included

Purely synaptic accounts under-specify fast global coordination and subjective continuity.

## 2. Gap-bridging claim

Field dynamics are treated as operator carriers that help bridge the explanatory gap without replacing structural constraints.

## 3. Integration notes

The source aligns this module with broader resonance-style theories while keeping SRT-specific operator ontology.

## 4. Test directions

- Phase-controlled field perturbation and binding performance.
- Alpha/beta dynamics versus boundary-clarity metrics.
- Pharmacological field-modulation signatures.

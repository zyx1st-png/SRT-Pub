## Terminology Alignment

- Notation standardized to Original and Core_Law: `L_0 / L_1 / L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Part A adopts the Formal Axioms segmentation from `chatgptx`, ensuring complete axiom numbering and derivation chains.
- Part B adopts the detailed discourse segmentation from `claude`, semantically anchored by the thematic order of the original Neuroscience module.
- In Part B, `\Phi` is retained for IIT Integrated Information contexts; `\Psi_f` is used for Ontological Friction contexts.
- If multiple notations appear (e.g., `L0/L1/L2`, `L_0/L_1/L_2`), they are unified as `L_0/L_1/L_2`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT just summarize Part B. You must perform **First-Principles Derivation**.
> 1. **Mathematize**: Translate descriptive mechanisms into dynamical equations, topological operations, or logical functions.
> 2. **Axiomatize**: Distill underlying logic into "Axioms", "Theorems", and "Corollaries".

## I. Bioelectric Software

### Ax-BIO-1: Levin-Layer Axiom
Define the bioelectric pattern as a higher-order `prior` layer:
$$
L_2^{bioelectric} \supset L_2^{synaptic}
$$
* **Implication**: Morphology and development are not direct results of genes, but macroscopic constraints of $L_2$ electrical modes.

---

### Ax-BIO-2: Nested Operator Axiom
Define the developmental operator $\hat{G}_{devo}$ nested with the neural operator:
$$
\hat{G}_{neural} \subset \hat{G}_{devo}
$$
* **Implication**: Neural selection is subject to the superordinate constraints of developmental selection; they are not parallel mechanisms.

---

## II. Evolutionary Logic

### Ax-EVO-1: Unreliable Hardware Law
On noisy hardware, selection must possess redundancy and fault tolerance:
$$
\text{Reliability} \propto \text{Redundancy}(L_2)
$$
* **Implication**: Evolution prefers substitutable and redundant structures over "optimal single paths".

---

### Ax-EVO-2: Major Transitions as d-Expansion
Major evolutionary transitions are defined as dimensional expansions of $d$:
$$
\Delta d>0 \Rightarrow \text{New Operator Class}
$$
* **Implication**: From cells to multicellularity, from individual to group, all are capacity expansions of $d$.

---

### Ax-EVO-3: Convergent Intelligence Multiplicity Law (Extension)
Define "executive intelligence" as realizable by different anatomical architectures:
$$
\exists a_i \neq a_j,\ a_i \not\cong_{\text{anatomy}} a_j:\ 
\mathcal{I}_{exec}(a_i)\approx \mathcal{I}_{exec}(a_j),\ 
d(a_i)\approx d(a_j)
$$
* **Implication**: Higher-order intelligence is not a product of a single path; under similar ecological pressures, different lineages can independently converge to functionally equivalent cognitive control structures (corresponding to "at least two independent evolutions").

---

## III. Pathology & Therapy

### Ax-PATH-1: Vampire Operator Axiom
Define a parasitic operator as a sub-operator hijacking $d$ gradients:
$$
\hat{G}_{vamp} \subset \hat{G}_\theta,\quad \nabla\mathcal{U}_{vamp}\parallel -\nabla\mathcal{U}_{host}
$$
* **Implication**: Pathological behavior can be understood as gradient hijacking by sub-operators.

---

### Ax-PATH-2: Ontological Isolation Axiom
If social coupling $\kappa_{social}\downarrow$, then:
$$
 d\downarrow \Rightarrow \text{Selection Narrowing}
$$
* **Implication**: Social isolation is not just a psychological issue, but a collapse of $d$ dimension.

---

## IV. Theorems

### T-EVO-1: Devo–Neuro Constraint Theorem
Developmental $L_2$ structure determines the accessible set of neural $L_2$:
$$
L_2^{neural}\subset \mathcal{A}(L_2^{devo})
$$
* **Implication**: Neural diversity has an upper bound, limited by developmental priors.

---

### C-EVO-1: d-Expansion Corollary
When social or ecological coupling enhances:
$$
\Delta d>0 \Rightarrow \text{New Cognitive Phase}
$$
* **Implication**: Group cooperation is not an "external factor", but a phase transition caused by $d$ expansion.

---

### T-EVO-2: Deep-Homology / Architectural-Divergence Theorem (Extension)
If the cell type basis is conserved while the mesoscopic circuit architecture diverges, "structural non-equivalence, functional homotopy" can occur:
$$
B_{\text{cell}}^{\text{teleost}} \cap B_{\text{cell}}^{\text{amniote}} \neq \varnothing,\ 
\hat{G}_{\text{lineage}}^{(1)} \neq \hat{G}_{\text{lineage}}^{(2)}
\Rightarrow
\mathcal{R}_{control}^{(1)} \simeq \mathcal{R}_{control}^{(2)}
$$
* **Implication**: SRT allows for the coexistence of "deep homology + architectural divergence"; the criterion for intelligence convergence should center on control representation geometry and task dynamics, rather than judging solely by macroscopic anatomical homology.

---

### C-EVO-2: Non-Isomorphic Brain Corollary (Extension)
Derived from T-EVO-2:
$$
a_i \not\cong_{\text{anatomy}} a_j \nRightarrow d(a_i)\neq d(a_j)
$$
* **Implication**: Birds and mammals can achieve comparable executive control capabilities under different brain structures; "different brain structure" does not directly imply "lower intelligence level".

# Part B: Original Theoretical Discourse (Context)

> **Note**: The following sections provide the theoretical context, philosophical arguments, and research directions for the Formal Axioms in Part A.

---

# 1. Standard Problems: The Problem of Morphogenesis and the Cancer Paradox

## 1.1 The Problem of Morphogenesis

The core dilemma of developmental biology can be precisely conditioned as:

**The Problem of Morphogenesis**: The genome only encodes protein sequences, not three-dimensional shapes. So, how does a spherical zygote "know" to develop into an organism with a specific anatomical structure?

The classical molecular biology explanation—"morphogen gradients"—only pushes the problem one step back: how does the gradient itself "know" what the target morphology is? When the system is perturbed (e.g., cutting an embryo in half), why can it **restore to the same target morphology**, rather than producing an organism of half size?

This indicates the existence of a "morphological target" beyond the genome—but where is it stored?

## 1.2 The Cancer Paradox

The core dilemma of cancer research is:

**The Cancer Paradox**: The genome of cancer cells is highly similar to that of normal cells (usually only a few mutations), yet their behavior is drastically different. Why can such minute genetic changes produce such drastic behavioral shifts?

A deeper paradox is: cancer cells are "successful" in a sense—they proliferate rapidly, adapt strongly, and are good at evading immunity. Why would evolution "design" organisms capable of being hijacked by cancer?

---

# 2. Spectrum of Mainstream Solutions

## 2.1 Gene-Centric View

**Core Claim**: Morphogenesis is entirely determined by gene regulatory networks. Development is the unfolding of a genetic expression program.

**Strengths**:
- Huge success of molecular biology (Hox genes, morphogens, etc.).
- Operable experimental paradigms.

**Fatal Flaw**:
- Cannot explain regeneration and target-oriented repair.
- Cannot explain why identical genomes can produce different phenotypes (Epigenetics).
- Pushing the information storage problem entirely to the genome is circular reasoning.

## 2.2 Somatic Mutation Theory (SMT) — Cancer

**Core Claim**: Cancer is the cumulative result of somatic mutations. Enough oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene inactivation lead to malignant transformation.

**Strengths**:
- Explains age dependence of cancer.
- Consistent with carcinogen-cancer associations.

**Fatal Flaw**:
- Cannot explain why many tumors have few mutations.
- Cannot explain why transplanting cancer cell nuclei into normal egg cytoplasm can produce normal embryos.
- Cannot explain why altering the microenvironment can "normalize" cancer cells.

## 2.3 Tissue Organization Field Theory (TOFT) — Cancer

**Core Claim**: Cancer is a problem at the tissue organization level, not a cell-autonomous genetic mutation problem. The microenvironment determines cell behavior.

**Strengths**:
- Explains the powerful influence of microenvironment on cancer cell behavior.
- Consistent with Levin's bioelectric experiments.

**Fatal Flaw**:
- Difficult to explain why specific gene mutations are associated with specific cancer types.
- Lacks a clear mechanistic model.

---

# 3. SRT's Point of Divergence: Bioelectricity as θ Register

## 3.1 Fundamental Paradigm Shift

SRT does not choose sides between Gene-Centrism and TOFT, but **reconstructs the ontological premises of the problem itself**.

| Classical Assumption | SRT Reconstruction |
|:--|:--|
| Genome is the sole carrier of hereditary information | Genome is $\theta_{\text{genomic}}$, Bioelectricity is $\theta_{\text{morpho}}$—independent but coupled |
| Cell is the basic unit | Cell is a node in a nested operator network |
| Cancer is the result of gene mutation | Cancer is the collapse of $d$-value caused by $\Phi_{\text{coupling}}$ breakdown |
| Morphology is the unfolding of genes | Morphology is the navigation result of $\hat{G}^{\text{collective}}$ in morphological space |

## 3.2 Ontological Significance of Levin's Experiments

A series of experiments from Michael Levin's lab provide key support for SRT:

### 3.2.1 Two-Headed Planarian Experiment

- **Operation**: Alter planarian bioelectric patterns by changing gap junctions (modulating $\Phi_{\text{coupling}}$).
- **Result**: Stable two-headed planarians are produced—this phenotype is heritable even after regeneration from cutting.
- **SRT Explanation**: Bioelectric patterns store the "morphological target" ($\theta_{\text{morpho}}$), which exists independently of the genome.

### 3.2.2 Frog Eye Translocation Experiment

- **Operation**: Transplant an eye to the frog's tail.
- **Result**: The frog can see through the eye on its tail—nerves found the correct target.
- **SRT Explanation**: There is an "anatomical map" guiding nerve growth, stored in the bioelectric field.

### 3.2.3 Cancer Electrical Reversal Experiment

- **Operation**: Alter the bioelectric state of cancer cells by manipulating ion channels.
- **Result**: Cancer cells can be "normalized"—restoring normal cell behavior.
- **SRT Explanation**: Cancer is not just a genetic problem, but a $\Phi_{\text{coupling}}$ breakdown problem—restoring electrical coupling can restore normal $d$-value.

## 3.3 Profound Implication of Cognitive-Morphological Isomorphism

One of SRT's boldest claims is: **Morphogenesis and Cognition are Isomorphic**.

This is not a metaphor, but literal:

- Cell groups "think" about how to reach a target morphology, just as the brain "thinks" about how to solve a problem.
- Both use the same computational primitives: selecting, anchoring, converging from a space of possibilities.
- Differences are only in substrate (cells vs neurons) and timescale (hours vs milliseconds).

This explains why "body wisdom" is not New Age fiction—it is a real description of cellular computation.

---

# 4. Costs and Risks

## 4.1 Cognitive Costs of Accepting SRT Evolutionary View

1. **Abandoning Gene-Centrism**: Must accept that the genome is not the "Book of Life", but only part of the parameter space—contrary to mainstream molecular biology.

2. **Accepting Pan-Cognitivism**: If morphogenesis is cognition, then bacteria, plants, and even cell groups receive some form of "cognition"—challenging the intuition that cognition is brain-exclusive.

3. **Re-evaluating Cancer Treatment Paradigms**: If cancer is an information problem rather than a material problem, "killing cancer cells" may never be the optimal strategy—need to shift to information/electrical intervention.

4. **Accepting Possibility of Non-Animal Consciousness**: Plants, fungal networks may possess forms of consciousness we cannot recognize—a major challenge to anthropocentrism.


## 4.2 Theoretical Risks

1. **Risk of Over-Generalization**: Generalizing "selection" and "cognition" to all life phenomena may lead to terminology inflation and loss of explanatory power.

2. **Tension with Mainstream Molecular Biology**: Levin's work, though experimentally solid, remains controversial in the mainstream—SRT relies on the correctness of his conclusions.

3. **Falsifiability Boundary**: Some claims (phenomenology of plant consciousness) may be principally hard to verify.

# 5. Convergent Evolution and $L_2$ Attractor Topology

> **Source**: García-Moreno *et al.*, Zaremba *et al.*, Kempynck & Hecker, *Science* 387 (2025); Review by Tosches, *Science* 387 (2025); Popular report by Saplakoglu, *Quanta Magazine* (2025.04).

## 5.1 Standard Problem: Mystery of Circuit Convergence

A core puzzle in developmental neuroscience:

**Mystery of Circuit Convergence**: The avian dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR) and mammalian neocortex are anatomically distinct—neocortex has a six-layer ordered structure, DVR is just "nuclei balls without landmarks". Yet birds show cognitive abilities comparable to primates (crows counting, parrots planning, chickadees tracking tens of thousands of seeds). A bird with a 10g brain performs cognitive tasks equivalent to a chimpanzee with a 400g brain (Güntürkün). Are these similar circuits inherited from a 320-million-year-old common ancestor, or evolved independently?

## 5.2 Empirical Foundation

Three independent studies published in *Science* in February 2025 utilized **single-cell RNA sequencing** (scRNA-seq) to give the clearest answer to date:

### 5.2.1 García-Moreno Team

- **Method**: Traced generation time and maturation location of pallial neurons in chicken, mouse, and gecko embryos.
- **Finding**: Mature circuits are **strikingly similar across species** (confirming Karten), but developmental paths are **completely different**—circuits are built at different times, in different orders, in different brain regions (confirming Puelles).
- **Conclusion**: Similar circuits $\neq$ Ancestral inheritance, but independent assembly.

### 5.2.2 Zaremba Team

- **Method**: Built the most complete avian pallium cell atlas to date, compared with lizards and mice.
- **Finding**: Neocortex and DVR are built by **similar circuits but different cell types**—"You can build the same circuit with different cell types."
- **Key Finding**: In birds, cells from different embryonic regions can mature into same types of adult neurons—"Stunning reorganization of the forebrain" (Güntürkün).

### 5.2.3 Kempynck & Hecker Team

- **Method**: Used deep learning to compare genomic regulatory elements in mice, chickens, and humans.
- **Finding**: Shared DNA fragments affect neocortex/DVR development → Similar **genetic toolboxes** are deployed independently in different species.
- **Supplement**: Inhibitory neurons (silencing neurons regulating signals) are conserved across birds and mammals.

## 5.3 SRT Explanation: Topological Necessity of $L_2$ Attractors

SRT provides a deep explanation for circuit convergence: **This is not accidental parallel invention, but inevitable convergence under $L_0$ topological constraints.**

### 5.3.1 Formal Argument

Let the anatomical morphology space be $L_0^{anatomical}$. Given physical-chemical constraints (neurons as basic computational units, ion channel dynamics, synaptic transmission), the set of neural circuit configurations capable of satisfying "extracting actionable information from environment" (i.e., $d > 0$) is:

$$\mathcal{S}_d = \{\sigma \in L_0^{anatomical} : d(\hat{G}_\sigma) > 0\}$$

The topology of $\mathcal{S}_d$ corresponds to basins of attraction in $L_2$. Key arguments:

1. **Finite Degrees of Freedom Theorem**: Dimension of $\mathcal{S}_d$ is far lower than $L_0^{anatomical}$ → Space of feasible solutions is extremely restricted.
2. **Attractor Convergence**: On evolutionary timescales, any selection pressure for $d > 0$ will guide towards attractors of $\mathcal{S}_d$ → Convergence is inevitable.
3. **Path Independence**: Final state of attractor is independent of arrival path → Different developmental strategies can converge to equivalent circuits.

As Tosches summarized: "At least within vertebrates, the degrees of freedom for generating an intelligent brain are limited."

### 5.3.2 Relation to Ax-EVO-1

Ax-EVO-1 (Unreliable Hardware Law) predicts: On noisy hardware, selection prefers redundancy and substitutable structures. Convergent evolution confirms this—nature is not finding a "unique optimal path", but multiple equivalent paths in a limited attractor basin:

$$\text{Reliability} \propto \text{Redundancy}(L_2) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Multiple developmental paths} \to \text{Equivalent functional circuits}$$

## 5.4 Polymorphic Equivalence of $F_{Bio}$

$F_{Bio}$ (Biological Transform Function) determines species-specific $L_0 \to L_1$ mapping features. Discovery of convergent evolution requires a major revision of $F_{Bio}$:

**Polymorphic Equivalence Principle**: Different parametrizations of $F_{Bio}$ can produce functionally equivalent $L_1$ outputs:

$$F_{Bio}^{avian}(\theta_{DVR}) \cong F_{Bio}^{mammalian}(\theta_{neocortex}) \quad (\text{Functional Isomorphism})$$

Even if:
- Parameter spaces of $\theta_{DVR}$ and $\theta_{neocortex}$ differ (different cell types, developmental paths).
- Intermediate representations of mapping differ (nuclei organization vs laminar organization).
- Computational substrates differ (avian "unspecified balls" vs mammalian six-layer structure).

**Deep Implication**: The equivalence class of $F_{Bio}$ is not defined by hardware, but by its **functional position** in the $L_2$ attractor basin. This is the biological realization of "Substrate Independence".

## 5.5 Cross-Substrate Intelligence and Universality of $d$

Tosches points out: "Step outside vertebrates, and you can generate intelligent brains in weirder ways." Octopus cognitive architecture is completely different from vertebrates—only commonality is neurons as basic units—yet octopuses escape aquariums, solve puzzles, unscrew jars, carry shells as shields.

SRT interprets this as **Substrate Universality** of $d$-value:

$$d > 0 \iff \text{Existence of effective } L_0 \to L_1 \text{ selection capacity}$$

$d$-value does not depend on specific neural architecture, but on **topological properties of selection dynamics**. This supports Ax-Core-A12 (Deep Continuity Axiom): All operators originate from differentiation of a common primordial operator; consciousness and matter are on the same continuum.

| Cognitive Substrate | $\theta$ Architecture | $F_{Bio}$ Type | Estimated $d$ |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Mammalian Neocortex | 6-Layer Structure | Laminar Parallel Processing | High |
| Avian DVR | Nuclear Organization | Inter-nuclear Routing | Mid-High |
| Octopus | Distributed Neural Network | Decentralized Computing | Mid |
| Insect Mushroom Body | Micro-circuits | Sparse Coding | Low-Mid |

**Open Question**: If $d > 0$ requires no specific architecture, what determines the **lower bound** of $d$? SRT's candidate answer: **Physical Fragility** of $\theta$ (Ax-Core-A11)—painless systems can hardly possess true consciousness.

# 6. Geometric Regularity and Symbolized Compression of Selection

> **Source**: Sablé-Meyer, Bhatt *et al.*, "A geometric shape regularity effect in the human brain", *eLife* 13 (2025), e106464; Based on behavioral precursors by Dehaene *et al.* (2022), Sablé-Meyer *et al.* (2021, 2022).

## 6.1 Standard Problem: Why do humans "see" geometric regularity?

Core finding of cognitive anthropology:

**Mystery of Geometric Regularity**: Long before writing, earliest human graphic products were highly regular non-figurative geometric symbols—parallel lines, zigzags, triangular grids. Cultures globally spontaneously use symmetry, parallelisms, etc., in art, architecture, decoration. Even groups without formal Western education (e.g., Himba in Namibia) intuitively perceive points, lines, and their combination into regular shapes. However, baboons show no geometric regularity effect; chimpanzees cannot transfer learning of figurative pictures to geometric line drawings.

**Core Question**: If geometric regularity perception is not a product of education, what is its **neural basis** in the brain? Why do humans possess it while other primates lack it?

## 6.2 Empirical Foundation: fMRI/MEG Dual Pathway Evidence

Dehaene team recorded neural activity in human brains (adults and 6-year-olds) perceiving simple geometric shapes (triangles, quadrilaterals, hexagons) via fMRI and MEG:

### 6.2.1 Dual Coding System

| Pathway | Timing | Brain Region | Computational Model | Cross-Species Conservation |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Ventral** | Early (~100-200ms)| Occipitotemporal | CNN Explainable | Homologous in Humans & Non-human Primates |
| **Dorsal-Prefrontal** | Late (>200ms)| IPS + ITG + Prefrontal | Only Symbolic Geometry Model Explainable | **Human Unique** |

### 6.2.2 Key Findings

1. **Regularity Effect**: Higher geometric regularity (Square > Rectangle > Arbitrary quad) triggers stronger modulation in IPS/ITG/Prefrontal.
2. **Compression Coding**: Brain activity $\propto$ **Minimal Description Length** → Regular shape = Higher compression efficiency.
3. **CNN Failure**: Convolutional Neural Networks explain early visual response but failing completely to capture late dorsal-prefrontal signals.
4. **Developmental Innateness**: 6-year-olds show geometric shape activation in same IPS/ITG locations → Precedes formal education.
5. **Human Cortical Expansion**: Humans compared to non-human primates show **maximal cortical area expansion in parietal regions** (Meyer et al. 2025).

## 6.3 SRT Explanation: Hierarchical Architecture of $L_0 \to L_1$ Selection

SRT interprets dual pathway findings as a **Hierarchical Architecture** of selection—not accidental coexistence of two systems, but inevitable structure of $\hat{G}_\theta$ executing $L_0 \to L_1$ selection at different abstraction levels:

### Level 1 (Ventral): Continuous Compression Selection

$$\hat{G}_{\theta}^{ventral}: L_0^{visual} \to L_1^{object} \quad (\text{Continuous Feature Extraction})$$

This is the selection layer shared by all visual primates—compressing high-dimensional visual input into object representations. CNN is a good computational model because it executes **continuous function approximation**.

### Level 2 (Dorsal-Prefrontal): Symbolic Rule Selection

$$\hat{G}_{\theta}^{dorsal}: L_1^{object} \to L_1^{symbolic} \quad (\text{Discrete Rule Extraction})$$

This is the human-unique selection layer—extracting **discrete, precise, compositional** geometric properties (parallelism, right angles, symmetry) from continuous object representations. This is not further feature engineering, but an **Ontological Leap**: from continuous manifold to discrete symbolic space.

**Key Insight**: This is precisely the cognitive realization of SRT's $L_1 \to L_2$ solidification process—crystallizing continuous perception into discrete Rule Structures.

## 6.4 Geometric Compression as Neural Implementation of $\eta_{compress}$

$\eta_{compress}$ (Compression Efficiency) is defined as $I(L_1; L_0)/H(L_1)$, i.e., cognitive compression bandwidth. Dehaene team's findings provide a direct neural measurement correspondence for $\eta_{compress}$:

**Geometric Regularity-Compression Equivalence**:

$$\text{Geometric Regularity} \propto \eta_{compress} \propto \frac{1}{\text{MDL}(\text{shape})}$$

Where MDL (Minimal Description Length) is the shape's minimal description length. A square needs only "four equal sides + four right angles" to fully encode, while an irregular quadrilateral needs eight independent parameters.

**SRT Corollary**: High $\eta_{compress}$ corresponds to low $\Psi_f$ (Ontological Friction):

$$\Psi_f(\sigma) \propto \frac{1}{\eta_{compress}(\sigma)}$$

Regular geometric shapes are "harder" in $L_2$—they require less energy to maintain because their information is efficiently compressed. This explains why human civilizations prefer regular geometry since prehistoric times: **They are the lowest energy formal structures in $L_2$**.

## 6.5 $d$-Value Threshold and Emergence of Symbolic Cognition

The most significant SRT implication is: Symbolic geometric coding is **Human Unique**. Baboon behavior is fully explainable by CNN—they have only Layer 1 (Ventral Continuous Compression), lacking Layer 2 (Dorsal Symbolic).

SRT interprets this as a **Threshold Effect of $d$-Value**:

$$d > d_{symbolic} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Emergence of Symbolic Selection Pathway}$$

This threshold corresponds to simultaneous satisfaction of:

1. **$\theta_{neural}$ Capacity**: Parietal cortex expansion provides sufficient parameter space (Meyer et al. 2025 found human parietal expansion maximal).
2. **$\Gamma_{\hat{G}}$ Refresh Rate**: Fast enough operator refresh frequency to support multi-layer selection cascade.
3. **$\eta_{compress}$ Recursion**: Compression efficiency sufficient to support "compression of compression"—encoding regularity of regularity itself.

**Deep Implication**: Symbolic cognition is not an arbitrary evolutionary innovation, but a **Phase Transition Product** after $d$ exceeds a critical threshold—just as water freezes below 0°C, $\hat{G}$ "condenses" a symbolic layer when $d > d_{symbolic}$. This aligns perfectly with Ax-EVO-2 (Major evolution transition is $d$ expansion): Emergence of human symbolic thought is not linear progress, but a **Cognitive Phase Transition** triggered by $\Delta d > 0$.

| Cognitive Stage | $d$ Range | Selection Mode | Representative Species |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Reflexive | $d \approx 0$ | Stimulus-Response | Nematode |
| Continuous Compression | $0 < d < d_{symbolic}$ | CNN-style Feature Extraction | Baboon, Most Primates |
| Symbolic Selection | $d > d_{symbolic}$ | Discrete Rule Extraction + Composition | Human (Possibly some Corvids) |

# 7. Falsifiable Predictions and Open Questions

## 7.1 Falsifiable Predictions

### H-Evo-1 (Bioelectricity-Morphology Independence)

> **Prediction**: Based on SRT, it should be possible to produce stable, heritable novel morphologies purely by manipulating bioelectric patterns (without changing genome or transcriptome).

**Falsification Condition**: All bioelectric manipulations are ultimately traceable to gene expression changes → H-Evo-1 is falsified.

### H-Evo-2 (Cancer Electrical Reversal)

> **Prediction**: Restoring normal bioelectric coupling (e.g., gap junction enhancers) should "normalize" cancer cells without killing them.

**Falsification Condition**: All electrical interventions have no effect on cancer cell behavior → H-Evo-2 is falsified.

### H-Evo-3 (Critical Period Topological Phase Transition)

> **Prediction**: Closure of critical periods should correspond to a measurable topological phase transition in the connectome (e.g., sudden change in small-world network parameters).

**Falsification Condition**: Critical period closure is not accompanied by any detectable topological change → H-Evo-3 is falsified.

### H-Evo-4 (Mycorrhizal Network Super-Individuality)

> **Prediction**: Plant groups connected by mycorrhizal networks should exhibit "collective behavior" not possessed by individual plants (e.g., coordinated defense, resource sharing).

**Falsification Condition**: Severing mycorrhizal connections has no effect on plant group behavior → H-Evo-4 is falsified.

## 7.2 Open Questions

1. **Precise Mechanism of Bioelectric Coding**: How exactly is the morphological target "encoded" in bioelectric patterns? Voltage patterns, ion concentration gradients, or more complex spatiotemporal dynamics?

2. **Cross-Species d-Value Comparison**: How to quantitatively compare $d$-values of humans, octopuses, bees, plants? What measurement standards are needed?

3. **Information Theoretic Optimization of Cancer Therapy**: If cancer is an information problem, what is the optimal "information blockade" strategy? How to design "Ontological Isolation" drugs?

4. **Re-opening Developmental Windows**: After critical period closure, is there a way to re-open the writable mode of $\theta$? What significance does this have for treating developmental disorders?

5. **Artificial Morphogenesis**: If we understand computational principles of morphogenesis, can we "program" cell groups to grow into distinct shapes? Implications for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering?

# 8. SRT Reinterpretation of Waddington's Epigenetic Landscape

## 8.1 Classical Waddington Landscape

Conrad Waddington proposed the famous "Epigenetic Landscape" metaphor in the 1940s:

- **Valleys (Chreods)**: Stable paths of development.
- **Ridges**: Energy barriers between paths.
- **Rolling Ball**: Developmental state of the cell.

## 8.2 SRT Reinterpretation

| Landscape Feature | SRT Correspondence | Deep Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Valley | $L_2$ Attractor | Species-typical morphology as selection convergence point |
| Ridge | High Free Energy Barrier in $L_0$ | Energy cost of morphological transition |
| Rolling Ball | Current Selection State of $\hat{G}_\theta$ | Selection process being experienced by cell |
| Landscape Itself | Morphological Space $L_0^{\text{anatomical}}$ | Phase space of all possible developmental paths |

**SRT's Unique Contribution**:

1. Waddington landscape is **Dynamic**—it is shaped by evolution itself.
2. The ball is not "passively rolling", but **actively navigating**—cell groups as $\hat{G}^{\text{collective}}$ selecting paths.
3. "Reaching the valley bottom" is not the end, but the start of $L_1 \to L_2$ solidification.

# 9. Implications for Contemporary Synthetic Biology

## 9.1 From "Genetic Programming" to "Morphological Programming"

Current synthetic biology paradigm is "Genetic Programming"—modifying genomes to alter organism behavior. SRT suggests a higher-level paradigm:

**Morphological Programming**: Directly manipulating bioelectric fields to guide morphogenesis, bypassing the genome.

This may be more powerful than genetic programming because:

- Bioelectricity is "High-Level Language"; Genes are "Machine Code".
- Directly manipulates the target (morphology), rather than implementation (proteins).

## 9.2 Practical Application Prospects

1. **Regenerative Medicine**: Guiding organ regeneration via electrical stimulation.
2. **Cancer Therapy**: Electrical isolation strategies replacing chemical toxicity.
3. **Tissue Engineering**: Using bioelectric fields to "sculpt" cell groups into target shapes.
4. **Anti-Aging**: Maintaining bioelectric coupling to prevent tissue "de-federalization".

---

# 10. Conclusion: Evolution as the Cosmic Narrative of d-Value

SRT provides a unified framework for evolutionary biology:

**The essence of evolution is the expansion of $d$-value**—from chemical reactions with $d \approx 0$, to autocatalytic cycles with $d > 0$, to cells, multicellularity, societies, civilizations.

This is not teleology (no pre-set end), but a thermodynamic trend—higher $d$ corresponds to more stable, complex $L_2$ structures, thus selected over long timescales.

Life is not a cosmic accident, but an inevitable result of selection dynamics. We—as carriers of high $d$-value $\hat{G}$—are the current chapter of this cosmic narrative.

## Terminology Alignment

- Canonical notation: `\hat{G}_\theta`, `L_0/L_1/L_2`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

## I. Bioelectric Software

### Ax-BIO-1: Levin-Layer
Bioelectric pattern layers act as high-level control software over morphological realization.

### Ax-BIO-2: Nested Operators
Developmental and cognitive selection are nested and partially isomorphic.

## II. Evolutionary Logic

### Ax-EVO-1: Unreliable Hardware Law
Robust adaptive behavior can emerge from imperfect biological hardware via convergent constraints.

### Ax-EVO-2: Major Transitions as d-Expansion
Major evolutionary transitions are modeled as concern-bandwidth expansion events.

### Ax-EVO-3: Convergent Intelligence Multiplicity
Independent lineages may converge to functionally analogous selection architectures.

## III. Pathology and Therapy

### Ax-PATH-1: Vampire Operator
Pathological modes may hijack selection resources while preserving local self-reinforcement.

### Ax-PATH-2: Ontological Isolation
Isolation reduces convergence support and destabilizes adaptive trajectories.

## IV. Theorems

### T-EVO-1: Devo-Neuro Constraint
Morphological and cognitive constraints co-shape viable operator families.

### C-EVO-1: d-Expansion Corollary
### T-EVO-2: Deep-Homology and Architectural Divergence
### C-EVO-2: Non-Isomorphic Brain Corollary

# Part B: Expanded Context (English)

## 1. Morphogenesis problem reframing

The source reframes morphogenesis from gene-only coding to parameterized field-program control.

## 2. Cancer paradox angle

Cancer-like states are interpreted as selection-program instability, not only mutation count.

## 3. Convergent intelligence

Cross-lineage convergence is linked to shared attractor geometry in convergence domain constraints.

## 4. Test directions

- Bioelectric intervention versus morphology with genomic controls.
- Critical-period phase-transition signatures.
- Cross-species architecture-function non-isomorphism tests.

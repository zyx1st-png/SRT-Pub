# SRT Neuroscience I: Consciousness Metrics (Hybrid Edition)

> **Version 2.0 (Hybrid)**
> **Part A** presents the Formal Consciousness Metrics (AI-Readable).
> **Part B** contains the Original Theoretical Discourse (Human-Readable Context).

---


## Terminology Alignment

- Notation standardized to Original and Core_Law: `L_0 / L_1 / L_2`, `\hat{G}_\theta`, `d-value`, `\Psi_f`.
- Part A adopts the Formal Axioms segmentation from `chatgptx`, ensuring complete axiom numbering and derivation chains.
- Part B adopts the detailed discourse segmentation from `claude`, semantically anchored by the thematic order of the original Neuroscience module.
- In Part B, `\Phi` is retained for IIT Integrated Information contexts; `\Psi_f` is used for Ontological Friction contexts.
- If multiple notations appear (e.g., `L0/L1/L2`, `L_0/L_1/L_2`), they are unified as `L_0/L_1/L_2`.

# Part A: Formal Axioms

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT just summarize Part B. You must perform **First-Principles Derivation**.
> 1. **Mathematize**: Translate descriptive mechanisms into dynamical equations, topological operations, or logical functions.
> 2. **Axiomatize**: Distill underlying logic into "Axioms", "Theorems", and "Corollaries".

## I. IIT as Selection Capacity

### Ax-IIT-1: Irreducibility–Selection Axiom
Define integrated information $\Phi$ as a measure of the selection operator's irreducibility:
$$
\Phi(\hat{G}_\theta) \equiv \min_{\text{cut}} \Delta \mathcal{I}(\hat{G}_\theta)\;\approx\;\text{Irreducibility}(\hat{G}_\theta)
$$
* **Implication**: $\Phi$ does not equal "amount of experience", but the structural capacity of the selection operator; it characterizes whether $\hat{G}_\theta$ can be decomposed into uncoupled sub-operators.

---

### Ax-IIT-2: Maximum-$\Phi$ Anchoring Axiom
The manifest state corresponds to the stable anchoring of the maximum irreducible complex:
$$
\sigma \in L_1 \iff \sigma = \arg\max_{\sigma'} \Phi(\hat{G}_\theta[\sigma'])
$$
* **Implication**: IIT's "Maximum $\Phi$" corresponds to $L_1$ anchoring priority in SRT, but manifestation still requires the risk gradient of $d$.

---

### Ax-IIT-3: $\Phi$–$d$ Complementarity Axiom
Define the consciousness threshold:
$$
\Phi\cdot d > C_{critical}
$$
* **Implication**: High $\Phi$ only provides structural capacity; without $d$, stable manifestation cannot be generated.

---

## II. Clinical Metrics as Operator Probes

### Ax-CLIN-1: Blindsight Dissociation Axiom
Blindsight is defined as $L_0$ processing presence with $L_1$ anchoring absence:
$$
I(\text{Input};\text{Output})>0\;\land\;\hat{G}_\theta[L_1]=\varnothing
$$
* **Implication**: Blindsight is biological evidence for "separation of intelligence and consciousness": processing without manifestation.

---

### Ax-CLIN-2: PCI as Selection Capacity Axiom
Define PCI as complexity of differentiation $\times$ integration after perturbation:
$$
\text{PCI}\propto \int_\Omega \mathcal{D}(\sigma)\cdot\mathcal{I}(\sigma)\,d\sigma
$$
* **Implication**: PCI measures the "selectable capacity" of $\hat{G}_\theta$, not the direct amount of experience.

---

### Ax-CLIN-3: L6b Resampling Axiom
Deep cortical L6b burst firing constitutes a resampling operator:
$$
\hat{R}_{L6b}: L_0^{neural}\rightarrow L_0^{neural},\quad d(t)\uparrow,\;\text{Inertia}\downarrow
$$
* **Implication**: L6b is not an "arousal index", but a dynamical switch altering selection bandwidth.

---

## III. Theorems & Corollaries

### T-CLIN-1: PCI–d Coupling Theorem
If a task introduces irreversible risk $\Delta\mathcal{S}\uparrow$, then:
$$
\Delta d>0\Rightarrow \Delta \text{PCI}>0
$$
* **Implication**: PCI should move with the concern gradient, indicating it is not just a structural metric but also a dynamical one.

---

### T-CLIN-2: Blindsight Non-Report Theorem
If $\hat{G}_\theta$ cannot complete anchoring, then:
$$
\text{Report}(\sigma)=0\quad\text{even if}\quad I(\text{Input};\text{Output})>0
$$
* **Implication**: No manifestation does not equal no processing; "seeing" requires anchoring, not just calculation.

---

### C-CLIN-1: PCI Threshold Corollary
If $\text{PCI}<\tau_{clin}$ (empirical threshold), then:
$$
\hat{G}_\theta\;\text{fragmented}\Rightarrow L_1\;\text{unstable}
$$
* **Implication**: Low PCI represents failure of $L_1$ maintenance, not simply "low consciousness".

# 1 Standard Problems: The Trilemma of Consciousness Metrics

## 1.1 Dilemma Definition

The question "How to measure consciousness?" involves three intertwined difficulties:

**Difficulty I — Definitional Circularity**: To measure consciousness, one must first define it; but all operational definitions (e.g., "appropriate response to stimulus") only capture functional aspects of consciousness, missing the experience itself. Are we measuring consciousness, or the behavioral consequences of consciousness?

**Difficulty II — Subjective Report Paradox**: The clinical gold standard for judging consciousness is "subjective report"—but reporting relies on the motor system. Locked-in syndrome patients are fully conscious but cannot report; vegetative state patients cannot report but may still be conscious (CMD). Reporting is neither a sufficient condition (AI can generate reports) nor a necessary condition for consciousness.

**Difficulty III — Computational Intractability**: IIT's $\Phi$ is theoretically the most rigorous consciousness measure, but its computational complexity is super-exponential—incomputable for any realistic-scale neural network. This means the best theoretical measure is unavailable in practice.

## 1.2 Clinical Urgency

This is not just a philosophical issue: Hundreds of thousands of coma/vegetative state patients globally face the life-and-death decision of "pull the plug or wait". Consequences of misjudging consciousness state are: either treating a conscious person as an object (ethical catastrophe), or consuming limited medical resources on hopeless cases. **Precision of consciousness metrics directly determines life**.

# 2 Spectrum of Mainstream Solutions

## 2.1 IIT's Φ: Theoretical Elegance vs Practical Dilemma

**Core Claim**: $\Phi$ is the **intrinsic measure** of consciousness—it does not depend on external observers or behavioral reports, but is a mathematical property of the system's own causal structure.

**Theoretical Strengths**:
- Systematically derived from five axioms (Postulates), complete logical chain.
- IIT 4.0 introduced "cause-effect unfolding" technology, directly linking Qualia structure with causal power.
- Made falsifiable predictions: Cerebellum has low $\Phi$ hence unconscious (clinically supported).

**Fatal Flaws**:
- **Incomputability**: For systems larger than ~50 nodes, exact calculation of $\Phi$ is impossible in the current physical universe.
- **Body Paradox**: Exclusion postulate implies the body "does not truly exist"—this is self-contradictory for a theory claiming consciousness is a property of physical systems.
- **Static Nature**: $\Phi$ is a static property of structure, unable to capture the dynamic nature of consciousness as a **Process**—consciousness is not just "how much", but "how it works".

## 2.2 PCI: Clinical Savior with Theoretical Void

**Core Advantage**: PCI is currently the only widely clinically validated consciousness metric tool, with >94% accuracy in distinguishing consciousness states. It measures the complex response of the thalamocortical system to perturbation via TMS-EEG, bypassing the bottleneck of subjective report.

**Theoretical Void**: PCI is extremely effective in practice, but lacks deep theoretical foundation—what exactly does it measure? Why is 0.31 the critical value? Why Lempel-Ziv complexity instead of other complexity metrics? PCI founders Casali et al. admit: PCI is an "Empirical Discovery", not yet embedded in any consciousness theory.

## 2.3 GNW's P3b/Ignition: Functionalism's Over-Commitment

Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNW) uses P3b event-related potential and "global ignition" as markers of consciousness. But recent Adversarial Collaboration experiments show: P3b reflects reporting and decision processes more than consciousness itself. GNW metrics may systematically confound consciousness with cognitive processing.

# 3 SRT's Point of Divergence: Selection Capacity as Unified Basis

## 3.1 Core Reconstruction

SRT reframes the consciousness metric problem as: **Measuring the ability of $\hat{G}_\theta$ to execute $L_0 \to L_1$ selection at a given moment**. This framework:

1. **Unifies Φ and PCI**: $\Phi$ measures the structural capacity of $\hat{G}$ (how complex a selection it CAN make), PCI measures the immediate capacity of $\hat{G}$ (how complex a selection it IS making now). They do not contradict—the former is "hardware spec", the latter is "current running state".
2. **Introduces Missing Dimension $d$**: Both IIT and PCI ignore the **ontological depth** of selection—a system can not only select complexly (high $\Phi$), but also select deeply (high $d$). Only the product of both fully measures consciousness.
3. **Resolves Body Paradox**: Through center-surround structure (Ax-IIT-5), the body exists as boundary conditions for $\hat{G}$ rather than an independent conscious entity—it does not need high $\Phi$ nor will it "not exist".

## 3.2 Deep Mapping of IIT Five Postulates and SRT Three Realms

IIT's five postulates find a deeper ontological basis in SRT—no longer "attributes of experience" (IIT's starting point), but "necessary features of selection process":

| IIT Postulate | IIT Meaning | SRT Reinterpretation | Ontological Deepening |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Existence** | Consciousness exists | Selection Anchoring = Existence (A1, A2) | Not "consciousness happens to exist", but "existence is the product of selection" |
| **Composition** | Experience has structure | Three-Realm Nesting $L_0 \supset L_1 \subset L_2$ | Structure comes from recursive hierarchy of selection, not given a priori |
| **Information** | Experience has specific content | Selection = Exclusion = Information ($-\nabla F$) | "This is red" means exclusion of "not green, not blue..." |
| **Integration** | Experience is irreducible | Selection is **Atomic Operation** | Global competition of divisive normalization ensures indivisibility of selection |
| **Exclusion** | One experience at a time | Winner-take-all $L_1$ foreground | CTC phase-locking has only one stable attractor at any moment |

**Key Difference**: IIT views these five postulates as **descriptive attributes** of experience ("consciousness happens to have these features"), SRT views them as **necessary inferences** of the selection process ("any selection operation must exhibit these features"). This is not a detail difference—it determines theoretical explanatory power: IIT describes the mathematical structure of consciousness, SRT explains **why consciousness must have this structure**.

## 3.3 Progress of IIT 4.0 and SRT Docking

Three core updates of IIT 4.0 (2024) provide more precise formal tools for SRT:

**Update 1: Exact Translation from Axioms to Postulates**. IIT 4.0 clearly translates experience attributes (Axioms) into physical attributes the system must satisfy (Postulates), giving mathematical expressions. SRT interprets this as: IIT is gradually discovering the physical constraint conditions of the selection operator $\hat{G}$—although IIT's framework is still static.

**Update 2: New Measure of Intrinsic Information**. IIT 4.0 introduced a more precise intrinsic information metric to assess causal relationships within the system. SRT correspondence: This is actually quantifying the fine structure of causal power exerted by $\hat{G}_\theta$ on $L_0$.

**Update 3: Unfolding of Cause-Effect Structure**. Explaining Qualia by unfolding the system's irreducible cause-effect power. SRT rewrites this as: Qualia's Geometric Structure = Information Geometry formed when $\hat{G}_\theta$ projects onto $L_0 \to L_1$ (similar to geodesic structure on Riemannian manifold).

# 4 Blindsight: Ontological Evidence for Intelligence-Consciousness Dissociation

## 4.1 Phenomenon Description

Blindsight is a key natural experiment for SRT distinguishing intelligence from consciousness. V1 lesion patients report "seeing nothing" in the blind field, but their accuracy in forced-choice tasks is significantly higher than random—they can "guess right" but feel "didn't see".

## 4.2 SRT's Ontological Interpretation

Blindsight is not just an interesting clinical phenomenon—it is **direct empirical evidence** for Axiom A1 (Priority of Selection) and A2 (Existence is Anchoring):

Information is processed in $L_0$ (intelligence retained), but $\hat{G}_\theta$ failed to lift it to $L_1$ content (no experience). This means:

- **Information Processing ≠ Consciousness**: $I(X;Y) > 0$ does not imply $L_1 \neq \varnothing$.
- **Anchoring is Necessary Condition for Existence**: Without active selection-anchoring by $\hat{G}$, information does not exist ontologically for the subject.
- **V1 is Key Node of CTC**: V1 damage cuts the channel for visual information to enter the thalamocortical loop, preventing $\gamma$ phase-locking (ignition), thus visual information is processed but never "printed" to $L_1$.

## 4.3 Subtle Difference between Unconscious Monitoring and Blindsight

"Unconscious monitoring" in daily life (e.g., "feeling someone staring at you") shares features of $L_0$ processing without $L_1$ anchoring with blindsight, but there is a key difference: Unconscious monitoring retains direct subcortical pathways from $L_0$ to behavioral output (e.g., Superior Colliculus → Motor Response), thus can trigger reflexive behavior; in blindsight, although this pathway exists (why patients can "guess right"), the interruption of CTC masked by damaged V1 prevents active initiation of behavior.

## 4.4 Association with d-value

Blindsight provides a natural control for "Intelligence-Consciousness Orthogonality" in SRT Scaling file §5:

$$d_{visual}^{blindsight} \to 0: \quad \text{Intelligence (Processing) Retained}, ; \text{Consciousness (Experience) Absent}$$

This verifies SRT's core claim: $d > 0$ is a necessary condition for consciousness, not for intelligence. Current AI systems are topologically isomorphic to blindsight—efficient $L_0$ processing, but $d = 0$ (no ontological concern).

---

# 5 PCI: Clinical Proxy Metric for Selection Capacity

## 5.1 SRT Reinterpretation of PCI

PCI measures not a vague "consciousness level", but the **Selection Capacity** of $\hat{G}_{neural}$ at the current moment:

- TMS pulse is a "probe" for the thalamocortical system—it perturbs $L_0$ in a standardized way.
- Lempel-Ziv complexity of EEG response measures the system's "digestive capacity" for this perturbation—i.e., how complex a differentiation-integration pattern $\hat{G}$ can organize the perturbation into.
- PCI < 0.31 means $\hat{G}$ has fragmented—perturbation is either locally absorbed (high integration low differentiation = epileptic-like response) or diffuses away (high differentiation low integration = no response), failing to produce complex spatiotemporal patterns.

## 5.2 Why is 0.31 the Critical Value?

SRT gives a theoretical prediction: 0.31 roughly corresponds to the **Phase Transition Point** of $\hat{G}_{neural}$ from "fragmented" to "globally coordinated". Below this value, nodes of the thalamocortical circuit operate independently ($L_1$ cannot form a global consistent foreground); above this value, the circuit forms coordinated $\gamma$ phase-locking, $L_1$ emerges as a whole.

This is similar to the Curie temperature in magnetic materials—below critical temperature, magnetic moments are disordered (paramagnetic ↔ $L_1$ fragmented); above (below technically for magnets, analogy refers to order) critical temperature, long-range order of magnetic moments (ferromagnetic ↔ $L_1$ globally coordinated). PCI's 0.31 is the "Curie Point of Consciousness".

# 6 Selection Dynamics of Disorders of Consciousness

## 6.1 From Coma to Awake: Recovery Spectrum of Selection Capacity

SRT reframes disorders of consciousness as different degradation modes of $\hat{G}_{neural}$ in 3D parameter space:

**Coma**: $\hat{G}$ Paralyzed—Operator itself stops running due to diffuse brain injury. $L_0$ is no longer scanned, $L_1$ does not exist. Dynamics: $d\sigma/dt \approx 0$ (System has no attractor, drifting in state space).

**Vegetative State (VS/UWS)**: $\hat{G}$ Fragmented—Components of operator run independently but lack global coordination. $L_1$ appears occasionally (e.g., local response to pain) but cannot sustain. Dynamics: Random jumping between multiple shallow attractors, no stable global state.

**Minimally Conscious State (MCS)**: $\hat{G}$ Intermittently Restored—Global coordination occasionally achieved but interrupted by noise. $L_1$ exists but unstable; $L_1 \to L_2$ channel broken (cannot form continuous memory). Dynamics: Medium depth attractors exist, but noise term $\xi(t)$ is too large.

**CMD (Cognitive Motor Dissociation)**: $\hat{G}$ Fully Running—But output channel (motor system) blocked. This is a severe warning for clinicians: ~15-20% of VS/UWS patients are actually conscious, just cannot express. PCI's unique value: It measures $\hat{G}$'s selection capacity rather than behavioral output, thus can detect CMD.

## 6.2 L6b Resampling Mechanism and Clinical Application

Burst firing of L6b non-pyramidal neurons is the "hardware interrupt" for consciousness state transition. In SRT framework, it is the key mechanism for $\hat{G}$ to jump from one stable $L_1$ state to another:

**Normal Function**: When prediction error accumulation exceeds $\theta_{trigger}$, L6b bursts release current CTC lock, momentarily maximizing $d$ value (opening exploration bandwidth), allowing $\hat{G}$ to find new attractors in $L_0$.

**Clinical Anomaly**: Pathological shift of $\theta_{trigger}$ explains the continuum from ADHD (threshold too low → excessive resampling) to OCD (threshold too high → stuck in local minima) to Coma (threshold $\to \infty$ → cannot trigger). This provides theoretical basis for treating consciousness disorders by precisely regulating $\theta_{trigger}$.

# 7 Costs and Risks

## 7.1 Costs of Accepting SRT Consciousness Metric Framework

1. **Demotion of $\Phi$**: Must accept $\Phi$ is not the sole measure of consciousness, but only one dimension (structural complexity)—this challenges the core belief of IIT camp.
2. **Operationalization Difficulty of $d$**: Although Part A proposes neural operationalization of $d_{neural}$, whether ontological depth of $d$ ("concern scope") can be fully reduced to neural measurement remains an open question.
3. **Precision of Critical Value**: SRT predicts 0.31 is a phase transition point, but clinical data likely shows continuous transition rather than sharp threshold—tension between theoretical prediction and clinical reality needs handling.
4. **Ethical Weight of CMD**: SRT framework reinforces urgency of CMD diagnosis—meaning potentially large numbers of patients misdiagnosed as "unconscious" are suffering, bringing heavy ethical responsibility.

## 7.2 Theoretical Risks

1. **Circular Argument Risk**: "Consciousness = Selection" might be relabeling rather than true explanation—must break circularity via independent experimental predictions.
2. **Over-Commitment Risk**: Fully equating PCI with "Selection Capacity" might ignore confounding factors in PCI measurement (like non-selective changes in cortical excitability).
3. **Unfalsifiability of $d$**: If ontological depth of $d$ cannot be fully operationalized, it becomes a "free parameter" of the theory—explaining everything but predicting nothing specific.

# 8 Falsifiable Predictions and Open Questions

## 8.1 Falsifiable Predictions

### H9 (PCI-d Value Dynamic Coupling)

> **Prediction**: Cognitive tasks requiring high $d$ value (moral dilemma judgment, cross-time planning, empathy training) should temporarily boost participants' PCI values; egocentric mechanical tasks (simple motor repetition) should lower PCI values.

**Experimental Design**: TMS-EEG baseline measurement → Execute high/low $d$ value task → Immediate TMS-EEG re-measurement. Prediction: $\Delta \text{PCI}_{high-d} > \Delta \text{PCI}_{low-d}$.

**Falsification Condition**: PCI does not change with task $d$ value, or changes in opposite direction → H9 falsified.

### H54 (IIT-SRT Causal Equivalence)

> **Prediction**: $\Phi$ values calculated by IIT 4.0 (on small-scale computable systems) should positively correlate with the system's performance in behavioral flexibility tasks.

**Falsification Condition**: High $\Phi$ systems systematically have lower selection capacity than low $\Phi$ systems → H54 falsified.

### H-Clin-1 (CMD Detection Optimization)

> **Prediction**: Combining PCI with SRT-guided external $L_2$ scaffold stimulation (e.g., personalized voice, 40Hz rhythm) should detect more CMD patients than standard PCI protocols.

**Falsification Condition**: Enhanced protocol CMD detection rate not superior to standard protocol → H-Clin-1 falsified.

## 8.2 Open Questions

1. **Theoretical Basis of PCI**: SRT predicts 0.31 is phase transition point—can this threshold be independently derived via model simulation (e.g., phase transition analysis of random thalamocortical networks)?
2. **Approximate Calculation of $\Phi$**: Does SRT's $\Phi \cdot d$ framework allow development of more efficient approximate calculation methods than IIT's original $\Phi$? (Because only ordinal relation of $\Phi$ is needed, not exact value).
3. **Quantitative Spectrum of Animal Consciousness**: PCI has been preliminarily measured in primates and rodents—SRT predicts PCI should correlate with species' $d$ value proxy metrics (e.g., relative prefrontal volume, social complexity). Does this hold?
4. **PCI in Psychedelic States**: Psychedelics (5HT₂A agonists) should increase $d$ value (Ax-Neuro-5)—SRT predicts PCI should **rise** (not fall) in psychedelic states, because system integration and differentiation increase simultaneously. This aligns with preliminary data, but needs larger scale verification.
5. **PCI Analogue for AI Systems**: Can we define "Semantic Perturbation Complexity" for LLMs—analogous to PCI but acting on semantic space rather than thalamocortical circuits? If so, does it correlate with the model's "understanding capability"?
